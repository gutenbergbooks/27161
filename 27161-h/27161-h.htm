<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>NEW YEAR'S EVE</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/h.png" width="118" height="200" alt="H" title="H" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br />E had gone, the good <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '  d'">old</ins> year! It
was no wonder people sighed as his
pulse beat slower and slower, for he
had brightened many hearts and gladdened
many homes. If he had brought sadness
and heart-ache to some, it was only that he
never once failed in any duty. Taking from
the hand that had given him life-joys and
sorrows, hopes and disappointments, crosses
and ease, he gave unto each one what the
Master designed. But it happens very often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that the rosy morning ends in a night dark
and tempestuous, while the clouds that greet
our early waking, are followed by the bright
shining of the sun. And there is no life
which would not be more bright and joyous,
if it only opened the windows and let the
light God means it to have, shine in.</div>

<p>So there were sighs and regrets as there
always are, when one who has been true and
kind, has left us forever.</p>

<p>Out on the frosty air floated the sound of
bells. Merrily, joyously they pealed forth to
welcome the new life that had just dawned,
while from far and near the guns gave out
their noisy greeting.</p>

<p>Sad hearts brightened, tearful faces smiled.
With their old friend had gone the old life;
they would throw aside regret and be brave
and strong. Among an assembly of silent
worshippers knelt two sisters side by side.
It was as if they had gathered round the bedside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of a departing one, trying to catch the
last look and to hear the last sound, the stillness
only broken by sobs from wrung hearts.
Tremblingly their girlish voices united with
the multitude, as with a covenant-keeping
God they renewed their covenant in the
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come, let us use the grace divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And all with one accord,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In a perpetual cov'nant join</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ourselves to Christ the Lord;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Give up ourselves through Jesus' power</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His name to glorify,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And promise in this sacred hour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For God to live and die.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The cov'nant we this moment make,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Be ever kept in mind;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We will no more our God forsake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or cast his words behind.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We never will throw off his fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who hears our solemn vow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And if thou art well pleased to hear,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Come down and meet us now.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thee, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Let all our hearts receive;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Present with the celestial host,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The peaceful answer give.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To each the cov'nant blood apply,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which takes our sins away;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And register our names on high,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And keep us to that day."</span><br />
</div>

<p>At the words, "We will no more our God
forsake," the voice of the eldest suddenly
failed, and burying her face she sobbed aloud.
The other seemed to have gathered strength
with every word, and now as she sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We never will throw off his fear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who hears our solemn vow;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>her voice rang out clear and steady. To her
sister it already had an air of triumph, and
caused her to look up wonderingly into the
face so full of trust and holy purpose. The
clear, bright eyes met her tearful gaze; there
was a pressure of the hand as entreatingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
she said, "Sing, Ruth; the <i>Lord</i> is our
strength, He will help us."</div>

<p>Re-assured and comforted, Ruth sang,
"To each the cov'nant blood apply," thinking
of her sister's words, and feeling already His
help.</p>

<p>The New Year's hymn was sung, friends
looked into each other's faces with words of
cheer, and then separated. They went their
ways to carry out their purposes, and with
them went Ruth and Agnes.</p>

<p>The girls were orphans. For ten years
they had been motherless, and several years
previous their father had died. They had
no one but their brother Guy, not even a
distant relative, and this made them cling
very closely to one another. One day when
Guy was in a very gay and gracious mood, he
took his sisters by the arm and whirling
them round sang, "Lovers three are we, no
truer could you see," to which Ruth laughingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
added, "And we'll faithful be, Guy,
Agnes and me."</p>

<p>But they were not demonstrative. That
is they rarely kissed each other; they did
not show their love in these many ways that
are so beautiful among brothers and sisters.
Somehow they had never learned them,
for their father had been a stern, forbidding
man, who would have called such things
"Stuff, and Nonsense," and their mother was
very timid, looking up to her husband in
everything. She would not have dared to
teach her children these endearing ways.
Sometimes she said "dear," and kissed
them, and O, how their hearts filled up with
love! It made them happy for days after.
But they always knew she loved them
even more than words or caresses could express,
and they gave her back the strength
of their young, loving natures. When she
left them they drew up closer to each other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in thought, loving silently, yet with greater
intensity.</p>

<p>Guy, the eldest, was twenty-two and
Agnes eighteen. He had just been admitted
to the bar, and expected to stand high in his
profession before long. His sisters were
sure if any one rose, he certainly would, for
he had not only ambition but talent, and in
speaking of "our Guy," they dwelt on the
name with great tenderness and pride. He
assured them that no one had made a higher
mount at first than he, having rented a third
story room, and as the girls did not know
much about such matters they were quite
satisfied.</p>

<p>Agnes was confiding, truthful. "Saintly,"
Guy called her. She did not know how to
reason about things as Ruth, she said, and
"of course was not so wise;" but withall
she was stronger and wiser, for she had
learned the true wisdom of leaving everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the hands of God, knowing that He
could better order them than she. And
knowing this, she did not question His providences,
although they were many times painful
and hard to understand. He was to her
always a loving Father, and she wanted to be
to him a loving, dutiful child.</p>

<p>Ruth was intensely earnest and more practical
than Agnes. She believed in the exercise
of judgment and not such entire dependence
upon the Lord; the latter kept one
weak she thought, and she did not see the
sense of doing anything that she could not
quite understand. So in spiritual things she
very often took her own way, but it did not
satisfy; her life seemed a life of failure, while
Agnes never appeared to be disappointed.
They often talked to each other about these
things and Ruth felt strange after their talks
and more confident of success, but her unsanctified
will, her efforts at self-government
brought the same result as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Guy was not a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'christian'">Christian</ins>, he had not even
gone much to church since he began to study
law, but he was a good, kind brother, and the
sisters were sure he would come out right
some time. If they had given the reason of
their assurance, Agnes would have said, she
prayed for it and believed that God would
answer prayer, while Ruth's reply would
have been, "He is our Guy, and of course
he will die a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'christian'">Christian</ins>." The girls did not
talk so much to their brother as to each
other; he could not understand their "spiritual
talks," and his life and theirs were after
all so different. But when he spent an evening
at home as he occasionally did, their joy
was extreme. Agnes then was sure the Lord
meant to answer her prayer very soon,
and asked to be directed so that she might
draw her brother to Christ by her consistent
life. Ruth exerted herself to the utmost to
entertain him. Watching him very closely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to see the effect of her efforts, and being rewarded
by some such remark as: "Ruth, you
are becoming quite brilliant; it will not do to
have you cooped up here; you must see more
of the world."</p>

<p>That satisfied her; she knew she was
doing him good, and she would not stop at
anything to accomplish her purpose. For
while she was not so keenly alive to spiritual
things as Agnes, she saw as Agnes never appeared
to see, the danger there was of his
being led astray, knowing how few real
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'christians'">Christians</ins> were to be found in the legal
professions.</p>

<p>The girls had had many struggles during
the last few years, even since Guy commenced
the study of law. And he had not
been without his difficulties. It had been a
hard fight between his love of profession and
love for his sisters. So that many a time he
resolved to throw aside his books and earn a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
livelihood in some other way, any way rather
than have them helping him. But whenever
he mentioned it, they seemed so distressed
that he yielded the point, resolved to study
with more earnestness so that one day they
might be proud of him. He did not know
already how proud they were, or what pleasure
it was to make sacrifices for him; for
they never hinted at the self-denial they
were called upon continually to practice.</p>

<p>It had occurred to Guy's mind frequently
that he ought to spend more time with his
sisters, that being alone, their evenings must
be dull; but home always suggested that
which he wanted to drive from his thoughts
as much as possible; hard toiling and sacrifice
on the part of his sisters. If he kept
this before him constantly, he reasoned, it
would so dishearten and depress him that his
chance of success would be naturally lessened.
Indeed his spirits must be kept up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
or he give up altogether. When he began to
make money, things should be very different;
he would devote himself entirely to them.
But with diplomas, fortunes do not come,
and so it was rarely that the girls had their
brother home with them. When they did,
we have seen how it cheered and re-assured
them.</p>

<p>On the death of their father it was ascertained
that very little support was left for
his family, and Guy entered a store at a very
small salary, while Ruth was compelled to
remain at home on account of her mother's
delicate health. She managed to obtain a
few scholars, however, and every month had
a little to add to the general fund. Agnes,
then too young to support herself or others,
continued to go to school, and in time received
a teacher's certificate. But as she
was not yet old enough to obtain a situation
in the public schools, she helped Ruth with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hers which had increased in size, making
quite a good appearance in the second story
back room.</p>

<p>They were at that time living comfortably,
when Guy, who had never liked the store,
expressed his ardent desire to study law.
He was rather surprised to find the readiness
with which his mother consented, and the
eagerness of his sisters. Speaking truthfully,
they thought him far above his present
business and much preferred that he should
have a profession. So it was not long until
he was in a lawyer's office. Then their
mother died. It seemed a very cruel thing
to Guy that she should be taken away just
now; if she could only have lived a few
years longer to see her son a great man; he
had determined to repay her for all her devotion.</p>

<p>Ruth soon had to do without her assistant
when Agnes, with a bright, cheerful heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
went out into the world "to help Guy and
Ruth." And now the sisters are teaching,
while "Guy Gorton, Attorney at Law,"
mounts his three flights of stairs daily, with
a great deal of hope, and as large a share of
importance.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />EITHER of the girls could tell which
awoke first on New Year's morning,
for as Agnes said at the breakfast
table, when they looked at each other they
were both awake.</div>

<p>Guy declared it was no wonder she graduated
with such high honor when she was so
extremely wise; and Ruth gave it as her
opinion that she always had been a most precocious
child, relating instances, some of
them so amusing that with the recollection
came a general outburst of merriment. "Do
you remember the time the Millerites were
making such an ado about the world coming
to an end, Guy, how she went to mother and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
asked if it twisted itself round and round
until it came to the end?"</p>

<p>"Don't I though, and the day she asked
mother if <i>vertigo</i> meant a monkey. When
mother told her no and laughed, she said
it must be some animal, for she read in the
paper that a man went up into a tree and
while there was seized with vertigo."</p>

<p>"And the day she was transferred to another
school, when she said she had a note of
transubstantiation."</p>

<p>"Yes, and"&mdash;Guy was about to continue,
but Agnes declared she was not going
to sit there as a target for their fun, and ran
laughing out of the room.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with yourselves,
girls?" asked their brother, as lighting
a cigar he prepared to go out.</p>

<p>"O we are going to stay at home and
have a nice time; you know holidays don't
come very often."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you women folks have queer ideas
of a nice time, if that is what you call staying
in the house. Why, it is enough to
make you stupid. Fix yourself up like
other girls, and promenade; that is what I
mean to do."</p>

<p>"What, fix yourself up like other girls?"
demurely asked Agnes, glad of an opportunity
to pay him back.</p>

<p>"O precocious child, I must be careful!"
and he started for his promenade.</p>

<p>"Be sure to be back at one," was Ruth's
reminder, and then the girls began to plan
their "nice time." "I'll wash the breakfast
dishes, Ruth, while you make the beds, you
tuck the counterpane in so smoothly and
have the pillows so straight," and Agnes,
with sleeves pinned up and crash apron on,
began her work. Her heart was very light,
and as she worked she sang:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Behold I come with joy to do<br />

</div>

<p>Ruth went up stairs and carefully spread
the counterpane and arranged the pillows,
but she did it mechanically. She was thinking
of what Guy said about "fixing themselves
up like other girls." She wondered
if he was dissatisfied with their appearance,
and if that could be the reason why he so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seldom went out with them. Then he said
they would become stupid if they did not go
out more. If she could be sure he did not
think them stupid now, she should not care.
But he could not think so, for he had told
her she was brilliant, and she knew she was
gayer and more entertaining to him than to
any one else, while as for Agnes, she was
too good to be stupid.</p>

<p>"I should like to dress better just for his
sake, now that he is a lawyer," she said with
a little thrill of pleasure and pride. "Of
course he will have a great many friends and
they will have to see us sometimes. But&mdash;"
here there was a pause and a deep sigh,
"O, he does not know how little we have
to dress with, if we would keep out of debt.
There now, Agnes is singing and I am doing
I scarcely know what," she added, as her
sister's voice reached her. She did not hear
the words, if she had heard they would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
helped her. As it was, she chided herself
for beginning the year so badly and hurried
down stairs to help prepare dinner. Both
she and Agnes decided it must be the very
best dinner they ever had, for Guy liked
good things, and on school days they had to
live plainly. If the pudding was not <i>plum</i>
pudding, it would be "almost as good," and
they set to work gleefully stoning the
raisins and beating the eggs.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be nice if we could live this
way always?" said Ruth, as she put a large
raisin in her mouth.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Agnes, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Agnes, do leave the <i>buts</i> and ifs out
once, and say that you would really like it."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I am sure it would be very
nice not to have to think and plan so much
about our way of living, and sometime I almost
wish we had more money for your sake
and Guy's, but&mdash;I can't help it, it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
come," as Ruth made an impatient gesture&mdash;"indeed,
Ruth, I should almost fear to be
rich."</p>

<p>"Why, for fear of losing your religion?
I thought you had more faith."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps that is the reason, Ruth,
my lack of faith on this point. If I consecrated
all but my money to the Lord, I
might fear, for it would not bring happiness
with it, but God's grace can dim even
the shining of gold to the Christian, so that
neither the eye nor the heart may be held by
it."</p>

<p>"It is when I look at the pitiful way in
which it is doled out, even to Him who gave
it, that I dishonor God by having such
thoughts. After all, the grace of submission
which we need, Ruth, is as hard to learn, as
any lesson that might come with riches; don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>Agnes left the room for a few minutes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Ruth did not reply. But the thought took
possession of her mind. "The grace of submission,
that is a hard thing to learn indeed,
at least for some people. I wonder if any
one ever submits <i>willingly</i>, or if it is not because
when they reason about it they find they
cannot do better. I don't know about this
thing of having no will of your own: some
people require greater strength than others.
Now there are Agnes and I so very unlike;
she could not manage and plan nearly
so well as I. So it is necessary for me to
have more strength of will because I have no
one to depend upon. If we had more money
it would be easier to be amiable and sweet,
for then I should not be perplexed. But I
must need a great deal of teaching, or rather
a willingness to be taught, and that is the
reason I can never see or feel like Agnes in
spiritual things."</p>

<p>Such a sense of want, such a longing came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
into her soul, that she almost cried out; but
Agnes returned, and driving back her emotion,
Ruth went on with her preparations.</p>

<p>With the greatest care Agnes set the
table, bringing out the best china, and arranging
and re-arranging until she was sure
everything was right, then she and Ruth
found it was time to dress.</p>

<p>"Fixing up like other girls," still ran in
Ruth's mind, and going to the wardrobe, she
selected her maroon colored merino dress, because
Guy said it suited her complexion.</p>

<p>"Your best dress and lace bow," exclaimed
Agnes, who considered herself quite well
dressed in her black alpaca, though it had
been turned, and a blue neck-tie.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ruth, "my best dress and
lace bow. Extravagant, isn't it? Promises
well for the year?"</p>

<p>"One would think you expected somebody."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I do; a gentleman."</p>

<p>"O, Guy, you mean; but what is the reason
you have your best dress on?"</p>

<p>"Indeed that is the very reason. I don't
know for whom I should want to dress, if
not for Guy."</p>

<p>"Of course, Ruth, we should do more for
him than for anyone, but you are so careful
of your good clothes, and so seldom wear
them at home."</p>

<p>"Well, I have been thinking perhaps I
had better pay more attention to my appearance.
Fix up a little more to be like other
people, I mean. One feels better satisfied
with herself when she is looking well. And
then, Agnes, as Guy goes more into society,
I fancy he is becoming fastidious."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," returned Agnes, re-arranging
her neck-tie. "How do I look,
Ruth; does this dress look shabby?"</p>

<p>"Shabby! one would scarcely know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it is not new. You always look well dressed;
but it takes a great deal of fixing to set me
off."</p>

<p>Guy's face showed his approbation as he
glanced over the table, and his "Why, girls,
this is a feast fit for a king!" carried with
it, greater pleasure, than the most graceful
compliment from other lips could have done.
After dinner they walked out together "to
see the New Year," Guy said; and the girls
felt sure that he must know all the great
men of the town, he bowed to so many.
Then he was not the least ashamed of his
sisters either, Ruth thought, and she became
quite animated, so that Agnes, who knew
nothing of the reason, wondered at the unusually
high spirits. <i>She</i> was very happy,
for she was with the two she loved best on
earth, and it seemed such a glad beginning to
the year. She smiled, talked, and looked to
where Guy pointed, seeing beauty in everything,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
even in the ragged children who
begged pennies as they passed along, for an
inward light gave the charm, and a sweeter
voice than that of brother or sister, made
gladness. Several visits were made that afternoon
to old friends who urged them to
stay for tea; and it would have been pleasant,
the girls thought, but Guy appeared
anxious to go home, so they yielded very
cheerfully. Guy had been planning a delightful
surprise for his sisters, and he meant
to make the announcement at the tea-table.</p>

<p>"Now for home and an early tea," he said
after making their last call.</p>

<p>The girls brightened at the thought that
home was really becoming attractive to Guy,
and although they had thought it would be
pleasant to free themselves from home duties
for one evening and enjoy it with their
friends, they lost sight of their own wishes
in their great desire to please Guy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the best place after all, isn't it?"
said Agnes, looking at her brother, who was
holding the door for his sisters to enter.
But his hasty, "Yes, hurry up with tea,
girls," gave a new turn to their thoughts.
Perhaps after all he meant to spend the
evening out.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it have been delightful if we
could have staid at Borden's?" asked Agnes,
sitting down at the foot of the bed, her favorite
seat, as she untied her bonnet.</p>

<p>"Indeed it would," was the reply. "I
don't know when I ever wanted so much to
stay. We might often go out for tea if it
were not for Guy, and that is one reason I
wish we could keep a servant."</p>

<p>"A servant would not be company for
him, Ruth, he would not come home at all
for tea if we were not here. But if he cared
more for our friends he would be more willing
to visit with us. I don't think, however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
men care to be from home at meal-time, and
I am so glad Guy is not dissatisfied with our
plain way of living, now that he sees so
much style and moves in such a refined circle."</p>

<p>"Where would be the use in being dissatisfied,
he knows it can't be helped," was
Ruth's reply as she turned to leave the
room.</p>

<p>"I thought you were hungry," remarked
Ruth, as Guy refused one or two dishes that
were handed him.</p>

<p>"Not very," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well that was cool, hurrying us home as
if you were on the point of starvation, and
now acknowledging that you are not hungry,"
said Agnes, laughing.</p>

<p>"O, I only wanted you to have tea over
soon, so that we could go out."</p>

<p>"Out!" exclaimed both, "where?"</p>

<p>"To the theatre, there is a splendid bill
for to-night. Look your very best girls."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>A deathlike silence followed this announcement,
and as Guy had finished, he rose from
the table and went into the parlor, leaving
his sisters sitting there. When he had gone
they looked at each other. "O, Ruth!"
said Agnes, sorrowfully. And Ruth replied,
sharply, "Well?" but it had a sound of
pain as if she had encountered some terrible
sorrow, yet meant to bear it.</p>

<p>"He will be so angry," continued Agnes.
"O, I wish we had staid at Borden's.
Hadn't we better tell him now that we cannot
go?"</p>

<p>"You can tell him for yourself, Agnes,"
and Ruth began removing the dishes with as
much haste as if she were eager to go.</p>

<p>"And you, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"I am going."</p>

<p>"Ruth, you certainly cannot mean it.
Going to the theatre and you a Christian,
and this is the first day of the year. O,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Ruth, remember last night and your covenant."
Her arms were round her sister now
as though she would hold her back from
evil, but Ruth shook her off, and ran hastily
up stairs to the school-room. Locking the
door, she walked up and down the room,
with hands tightly clasped and a face expressive
of the strongest conflict.</p>

<p>"Last night, and your covenant," yes, she
remembered only too well. But was not she
right in this? Guy <i>would</i> go to these places
and he must not go alone. Her sister was
the best one to go with him. He could
never go wrong if she were with him. What
was the use of praying that he might become
a Christian, and leaving him to go alone as
he chose. No, she would win him over.
He should see that Christians did not have
to attend church and pray all the time, for
that would make him dislike religion, but
that they were like other people, only better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When all this was settled, she began her
preparations tremblingly, thinking how very
plain her dress would be compared with the
handsome dresses, to be seen there, but determined
to appear well for Guy's sake, and
not to let him know the struggle she had
passed through.</p>

<p>As she left the school-room and ascended
the short flight of stairs leading to their bedroom,
she heard Agnes and Guy talking.</p>

<p>"She is telling him," she said. "O, I wish
I could be Agnes! but we are differently
constituted, and there are different requirements
made of us. Agnes does the praying,
and I must make the efforts, the sacrifices."</p>

<p>Yes, Agnes was telling her brother. She
had not to reason as to what was right or
wrong in this case, having read that we are
to shun every appearance of evil, and to keep
ourselves unspotted from the world. Her
heart beat fast, and her voice trembled, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not with indecision; for her soul was strong
in its purpose to do right at all cost as she
entered the room and said:</p>

<p>"Guy, I can't go to the theatre."</p>

<p>"What's the reason you can't?" was the
surprised inquiry.</p>

<p>"Because our church does not allow it,
and <i>I</i> do not think it is a good place."</p>

<p>"You don't! how do you know when you
never were there? See here, Agnes, don't
be a simpleton. Where is Ruth? I'll be
bound she'll go; she has good sense and
good taste. I saved up cigar money this
week on purpose to take you. Hurry now,
or we shall not get good seats."</p>

<p>"I can't do wrong, Guy; I must not go;"
and Agnes went out of the room, back into
the bright little kitchen where she had been
so happy that morning. She wanted to go
to her own room, but Ruth was there.</p>

<p>Guy was angry, very angry, Agnes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
thought, from his voice as he spoke to Ruth,
but they passed out and she was alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>GUY OR CHRIST.</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="142" height="200" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><br />HERE are times when the soul isolates
itself and is with God only; although
in the midst of a multitude.
Then, although seeming alone, it has companionship,
it is not lonely. And there are
hours of heart-felt loneliness, though surrounded
by a crowd, when no look, word or
touch of another can reach our hearts, so
separated are we.</div>

<p>Agnes had felt all this, but never before
did she feel such a complete and painful separation
as when the door had closed and she
was left. Ruth had made a sacrifice for
Guy. She knew it must have been very
hard to do it, and only her love for him could
have induced her to go. But Ruth did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
love him better than she. He would not understand
that, and would think that want of
love had prevented her from yielding. But
O, if he could see her heart, if he could
know how willingly she would give up her
life for him, how gladly she would sacrifice
everything but principle to satisfy him.</p>

<p>"And I can't tell him," she thought; "he
would not understand it, but think I was
trying to excuse myself, for we never talk
like other brothers and sisters about our love
for one another." Then came the question,
"Why must I suffer and be misunderstood,
when Ruth can act differently?" But again
the voice was heard that ever brought calm
and sweet assurance, saying, "Is this your
love for me? He that loveth father or mother
more than me, is not worthy of me, but he
that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."</p>

<p>"O yes," was the response, "I would do a
great deal for love of Guy, but more, far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more for love of Jesus;" and so for His love
she was willing to lose even Guy's love for a
time if necessary, and could bear to be misunderstood
if the Saviour trusted her.
There was no shrinking from the thought of
telling Him; no fear of being misunderstood
there, so kneeling down, she poured forth
the story. There were not many words, for
as sometimes in opening our heart to a
friend, we look up and catch a glance which
tells us there is no need of further explanation,
so she looked and felt that she was understood.</p>

<p>Earnestly she plead for her brother and
sister. That <i>he</i> might soon learn to walk in
other paths, and that <i>she</i> might lean more
fully on Christ and less on her own understanding.</p>

<p>One thing perplexed her; that was whether
she had better remain up until Guy and
Ruth returned, and if she did, how she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ought to act. It would not do to ask them
about the performance, as that would revive
unpleasant thoughts; and if she did not
speak at all, they might think her in an ill
humor. But she determined not to let this
disturb her, the Lord, she knew, would help
her to do right when the time came.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! if she is not sitting up
waiting for us," exclaimed Guy, quite gaily,
with no sign of displeasure in tone or manner.
"Weren't you dull? Confess now
that you cried a little because you did not
go? Look at her eyes, Ruth, didn't she?"</p>

<p>Not appearing to notice his last remark,
Ruth playfully reminded her of her newly-formed
resolution to rise at an earlier hour
than heretofore, and told her to be sure and
call <i>her</i> when breakfast was ready, for she
was so sleepy she did not know when she
should waken. Agnes good-naturedly promised
to do so, provided she was awake herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and ran up stairs, glad to escape from
her brother. Ruth followed her in a few
minutes, and going over to the dressing glass
stood looking in. "How well you look to-night,
Ruth," said Agnes admiringly. "I
do not think I ever saw you with such a
brilliant color. Did you enjoy yourself?"
The question was put hesitatingly, as if she
was not sure whether to put it or not.</p>

<p>"No, did you think I could? I can't even
tell you what the play was, my brain was in
such a whirl. But I laughed and talked and
Guy was satisfied."</p>

<p>She sighed wearily as she laid aside her
ornaments, and the tempter ever ready to
take advantage, whispered to Agnes, "<i>She</i>
suffers for her brother's sake, but <i>you</i> will
not."</p>

<p>"No, not even for Guy, if it displeases the
Lord. I must not let this move me," was
the quick response.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no more said by the sisters
that night. Agnes longed to help Ruth back
to peace of mind, but Ruth did not seem disposed
to enter into conversation, so there
was only one way in which to do it, and her
sister's case was given over to the One who
alone can ease the burdened conscience, and
Agnes slept undisturbed.</p>

<p>Ruth knelt as usual before retiring, but
she could not reach up through faith to
grasp the blessed promises; something kept
her down and widened the distance between
her and the Saviour. No sweet assurance
came, for there had been other thoughts before
those of pleasing Him. She had acted
according to her own judgment and pursued
the course she thought best. She had not
the comfort of knowing that He directed her
paths, because she had not in all her ways
acknowledged Him.</p>

<p>"I think it is the hardest thing I have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
overcome, Ruth," said Agnes, as she came
down quite late and found breakfast ready.
She felt condemned and dissatisfied with
herself, not knowing what to do, having
prayed about it so often.</p>

<p>"How do you pray?" inquired Ruth,
rather amused at her sister's distress.</p>

<p>"Why, I ask the Lord in faith to help me
to get up."</p>

<p>"That is, you expect the Lord to set you
right out on the floor?"</p>

<p>"O, Ruth, you are making fun."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am in earnest; that seems to
be what you expect. Now if I prayed about
it, I should ask that I might have my senses
about me when I was called, so that I might
think what I ought to do, and <i>do</i> it. That
is about as much as the Lord will do, and
then if we fail, the fault is our own."</p>

<p>"Will you call me to-morrow whenever
you waken, Ruth? I must have been making
a mistake all along."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>After that there was no more difficulty,
and Ruth told her she was to be envied,
having overcome her last failing.</p>

<p>"I wish I had," was the earnest reply,
"but I have any number of faults that you
do not see."</p>

<p>"Then I should not call them by such a
hard name, if they were modest enough not
to thrust themselves out to public gaze."</p>

<p>"You would not? It is only grace that
keeps them within bounds, and I am quite
as conscious of them as if they were seen.
They do not, however, overcome me as they
might if others saw them. But after all,
Ruth, I think we often call things faults in
others, that would be virtues, if we knew
more of their lives and the motives that
prompted their conduct."</p>

<p>"It is probable," said her sister, "but
there is not much of this getting to understand
each other's natures. There is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
enough trouble taken to find one another
out."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>LITTLE PHILIP.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="142" height="200" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HERE never was a greater contrast
than that presented by the two sisters
in their mode of government.
Entering the school-room of each, you could
not detect the least difference in the order
of the scholars, but while the result appeared
the same, the methods were very different.</div>

<p>Ruth said "silence" or "looked silence,"
as the children expressed it, and there was
silence. She spake and it was done, for the
children well knew that she would have no
disobedience. She was never unkind, and
she loved children, though she seldom
showed them her love; so if you had asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
her scholars if they loved their teacher, they
probably would have said they thought her
nice and kind, for she did not whip, and she
tied up their cut fingers.</p>

<p>It did not look dignified, some people
thought, and they were sure Miss Agnes had
no control over her scholars, as they saw her
surrounded by them every day on her way
to and from school. It was such an honor
to carry her lunch basket, such delight to be
first to meet her and have a place at her side.
O, how they loved her! "She was the very
nicest teacher that ever lived." And many
even resolved not to study too hard for fear
they should be promoted and have to leave
her. Then when the time came for them to
leave, such tears were shed at parting, that
Agnes determined not to allow herself to be
so loved in the future, and succeeded for a
day or two; but it was strange, she did not
know how it came, there was always the
same ending.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth assured her she would get over all
that in time; but love was as necessary to
Agnes as sunshine is to flowers, and among
these little ones the pent up fountain found
an outlet.</p>

<p>Ruth kept her love away, deep hidden
from sight, when it became so intense that it
was almost painful; in the other nature it
kept bubbling up and running over whenever
it found a heart that would receive it.</p>

<p>Agnes delighted in teaching, but Ruth,
while just as faithful, taught because it was
the best thing she could do, rather than from
choice. But the duty was irksome, and
often she longed to throw the book from her
and give the scholars their dismissal. When
such feelings possessed her, she "did penance,"
as she said, by giving special attention
to the lessons, "for it would not do to
have the children suffer from her whims."</p>

<p>One day there came to her school a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
deformed boy, about eight years old. He
had been brought there by one of the scholars,
and when Ruth entered the school-room
she did not notice him, but proceeded with
the opening exercises. She had taught the
children to repeat with her alternate verses
of Scripture, and this morning selected the
twenty-third Psalm. After she had repeated
the first verse, the scholars took up the second.
But there was one voice, clear and
distinct, above all the others. Glancing
round, she saw a pale face, whose large, earnest
eyes, bent full upon her, touched her
strangely. Slightly averting her head, she
went on where the children left off, but still
there was the fixed look. It was not a stare
or look of curiosity, such as a new scholar
might show, but penetrating as though the
child had passed through deep experiences,
maturing the intellect while the body was
dwarfed and feeble. At the close of the exercises,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a little girl taking him by the hand,
led him up to the desk, and introduced him
as a new scholar.</p>

<p>"What is his name?" inquired Ruth.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her; mother said I should be a
man and speak out. My name is Philip
Driscoe," and here the thin tiny hand was
slipped in Ruth's. How very thin and white
it was, like a baby's hand. As it lay for a
moment in Ruth's the fingers closed over it,
and stooping down she kissed the child. "I
like you, you are good, like mother," and
drawing closer he laid his other hand over
hers by way of caress.</p>

<p>A sudden impulse seized her to take him
in her arms, but the children were there,
looking on understandingly. Holding both
hands she bent smilingly down, but in an instant
her eyes were full of tears. She was
thinking of Guy. What if he had been thus
afflicted? A thrill of gladness followed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
pain occasioned by the thought, and collecting
herself she took the child over to a seat in
the middle of the room, promising him a
book in a little while.</p>

<p>"And a slate and pencil to make pictures?"</p>

<p>"Yes, can you draw pictures?"</p>

<p>"O, elegant ones; mother says I'll make
real ones when I am a man, if I don't die."</p>

<p>Ruth could not tell what to make of herself
that day, or for many days after, she was
so drawn toward that little face. "Now if it
had been Agnes, it would have been quite
natural."</p>

<p>But the truth was, wherever there was
suffering or weakness of any kind, her heart
threw off its casing, and she felt that she
could do anything to shield or comfort.
When the call came for strength or sympathy,
she could give it unhesitatingly, but
when there was only ordinary occasion, she
made no response.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED ONE DAY.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 114px;">
<img src="images/a.png" width="114" height="200" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />T the beginning of the year, Agnes
had resolved not to let a day pass
without having benefitted some one.
"It may only be perhaps by looking pleasantly,
or speaking tenderly, yet if done in
the right spirit, the Lord will accept it and
make it result in some good," she argued.
And in the spirit of this mission she started
for school one morning.</div>

<p>"What a wonderful thing it is to know
that while there are millions of people on
the earth, there is something for each one to
do, that no one else can do. A work the
Lord has laid out for each one of us," were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
her thoughts as she walked. But another
thought followed: "How do you know your
own work? you may be doing the wrong
thing after all."</p>

<p>This was not the first time such a suggestion
had been made. Once it troubled and
bewildered her, but now her mind was clear
on that point.</p>

<p>"For," she reasoned, "my work must be
to do everything that comes in my way, as
well as I can, without waiting for special
calls. And if I do this faithfully, and the
Lord sees that I can do a different work, he
will turn my mind in the direction of it, and
bring it near to me."</p>

<p>Her reflections were disturbed by the loud,
eager voices of several of her scholars, who
announced in one breath, "O, Miss Agnes,
you ought to have seen Martha Nelson's
father. He had his leg cut off, and they
took him on a settee to the hospital, and
Martha's mother is nearly crazy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"How was it?" inquired Agnes, turning
from one to another of the eager, frightened
faces.</p>

<p>"Why, he drives a dray, you know, and he
fell off when the horse was going fast, and the
dray ran over him. Everybody says he was
drunk."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, we must never speak of
another girl's father, as we would not like
to have our own spoken of. Poor Martha,
she will need to-day something that each of
us can give her. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Pity," said one of the girls, who by look
and voice showed that her heart was already
touched.</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"And love," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, the dear Lord wants us all to do
something for Him to-day, and as we cannot
do great, hard things, He wants us to love
and be sorry for Martha. And if we love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
people, we will do all the kind things we
can for them; don't you think so, especially
when they are in distress. And when we
say our prayers, we must not forget to ask our
Heavenly Father to love and care for Martha,
now that her father is away from her, and
may perhaps never get well."</p>

<p>When the lessons were over and school
dismissed, Agnes hastened to the home of
poor Martha. It was quite a distance from
her own home, being at the other end of the
town, and this was prayer-meeting night.
But her day's work could not be complete
until she had sympathized with these suffering
hearts.</p>

<p>"Here it is, teacher," exclaimed the children
who had offered to show her the way,
"The house with the shutters shut tight."</p>

<p>Knocking, and then trying the door which
she found unfastened, she entered the darkened
room, having told the children it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
not be best for them to go in on that day.
A sad disappointment, for they had meant to
kiss Martha and tell her they were sorry, and
hear all about the accident, although some
of them had witnessed it.</p>

<p>Passing into the back room, Agnes found
Mrs. Nelson and her children surrounded by
a half dozen neighbors, in the midst of a discussion
as to the position of the poor man
when he fell. The one who had the floor
at that moment was a tall, vigorous looking
woman, who evidently had battled hard to
occupy her present position. She had gone
as far as: "'Says I to my man, there goes
Bill Nelson;' and says he to me, 'Yes, there's
no fear of his old woman letting him over-sleep
himself; she's too smart for that';
when, all at once I seen him fall with his
head to the horses' hind feet and&mdash;&mdash;" here
the entrance of Agnes, whose knock had not
been heard, caused the speaker to subside,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and a general movement of chairs and stools
to take place.</p>

<p>"O, it's teacher, mother," said Martha,
springing to meet her, light coming into her
heavy, swollen eyes.</p>

<p>"And how do you do, ma'am; it's kind of
you to come. And it's a sorry day this has
been."</p>

<p>By this time chairs had been backed until
they could go no farther, aprons smoothed,
and the sleeves of the tall orator pulled
down. Then there was silence, Agnes having
taken one of the three chairs offered her.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Nelson, this is a sad occurrence.
You have need of a great deal of
sympathy, and I am sure you will have it."
As Agnes looked round the room, and saw
the various expressions of countenance at this
remark, they appeared so ludicrous that under
any other circumstances it would have
been hard to control herself. As if encouraged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by her notice, the tongues were again
set in motion, and to her horror she was
having all the details of the accident.</p>

<p>Martha had drawn her stool beside her
teacher, who now took the opportunity of
whispering comfort, and telling her how
much her school-mates loved her and sympathized
with her.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come when school
was out, but it seemed so long. Did anybody
have to be kept in?"</p>

<p>"No, the scholars were all quiet and attentive
to-day; they were thinking of their
little school-mate."</p>

<p>At these words, meant to comfort and reassure,
the child laid her head on her lap and
broke into loud sobs. Agnes thought she
had done harm rather than good, and the
tears sprang to her own eyes. Placing her
arm round the child, she drew the bowed
head up and let it rest on her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor thing," whispered the neighbors,
"she takes it hard."</p>

<p>With a great effort Martha looked up into
her teacher's face and said: "I wasn't thinking
about father then."</p>

<p>Not knowing but what the child might
have some trouble that she could relieve,
Agnes whispered: "What were you thinking
of? Don't fear to tell me; perhaps I
can help you."</p>

<p>"O, teacher," and there came a great
sigh, "you help me all the time. Nobody
ever was like you, and it was because you
were so kind I had to cry."</p>

<p>There were other wet cheeks than Martha's
then, and Agnes was already repaid for
her long walk. With a few more kind
words addressed to Mrs. Nelson, she rose to
go, and Mrs. Nelson followed her into the
other room.</p>

<p>"How can you manage without your husband?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Had you anything but his wages?"
she inquired, feeling that sympathy at this
time might perhaps require a stronger expression
than words.</p>

<p>"That is just what I've been thinking of,
Miss, if I could get time to think. They are
well meaning, you see," pointing toward the
other room, "but they have no considerateness.
It's not for me to sit down and be
grieving over what can't be mended, but to be
looking round for a way to bring bread into
the house. For as you asked me, Miss, I'll
just tell you. We haven't even had all his
earnings; if we had, this wouldn't have happened
to him. But I'll not hear a word said
against him there," with another glance
toward the back room. "I'll try, if God
spares me, to keep starvation out, and maybe
when he is lying there, something good may
come into his mind."</p>

<p>"If you could only spare Martha to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
out at service for a while, she might help
you. At any rate you would have one less
to feed," Agnes ventured to remark.</p>

<p>"That is just what came into my head
this afternoon, Miss. The one next to Martha
is old enough to take care of the rest
when I am out, and if you could hear of a
nice place where they wouldn't be too hard
on her, I'd be a thousand times obliged to
you, if you'd speak a word for her. She sets
great store by you, and a word from you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'as is her'">as her</ins>
teacher, would do more good than if
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'i'd'">I'd</ins> talk for a week."</p>

<p>Agnes promised to do what she could, and
then timidly, but earnestly, reminded her of
the sure help in the time of trouble, the one
whose friendship and love are equal to all
our demands. By the time she reached
home, Ruth was becoming anxious, for when
Agnes intended going anywhere after school,
she always announced it before leaving in
the morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowing that her sister would probably
be uneasy, and that she should have little
time to prepare for church, she almost ran
home; so that when she entered breathless,
her face a deep crimson, Ruth's tone of
alarm, as she exclaimed, "What is the matter,
Agnes!" brought Guy immediately into
the room.</p>

<p>"O, nothing Ruth; please wait until I
breathe;" and she tried to get up a laugh.
"I did not know I was so out of breath. If
you wait a minute, I will explain," for Ruth
was beginning to protest that something was
wrong.</p>

<p>"There now," she said, removing her hat,
and leaning back in the rocking chair, "I am
ready to put your fears to rest." Then followed
an account of the accident and her
visit to the family.</p>

<p>"See here, Agnes, it is all very well to
sympathize with people in distress, when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
don't have to sacrifice yourself; but you are
not called upon to do more than you are able
to perform. And it is quite enough for you
to teach school, without running to see all
the youngsters whose fathers get tipsy and
break their legs," was the opinion Guy gave
after hearing her story.</p>

<p>"What do you charge for advice, Mr.
Lawyer?" she asked, laughingly, as springing
up she advanced to the table and begged
Ruth to hurry with the tea, for she was "as
hungry as a hawk."</p>

<p>Guy followed, declaring that "if all clients
were as self-willed and independent as she,
the lawyers might pull down their shingles,
take a last look at Coke and Blackstone and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, and then?"&mdash;queried Ruth, very
much amused.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;&mdash;then go to grass."</p>

<p>"Little boys should not use slang," said
Agnes, demurely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither should little girls act contrary to
the wishes of their big brother," was the
reply.</p>

<p>After a blessing had been silently asked,
Agnes said:</p>

<p>"Do you really think I am self-willed,
Guy?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do; it does not require a
knowledge of law to decide that."</p>

<p>"How do I show it? I never meant to be
so."</p>

<p>"Well, you succeed pretty well if you
don't. I should not like to see you make the
effort, if that is the case. How do you show
it? Why, by thinking you know better
than other people. Don't she, Ruth, and
acting out her thoughts?"</p>

<p>"You are partly right and partly wrong,"
was the reply. "Agnes is not in the least
self-willed. It is I who may be called that.
In this you are wrong. You are right in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
saying she acts out her thoughts; but you
give a wrong reason. It is not because she
thinks she knows better than others. She
does not trust her own judgment nearly as
much as either you or I."</p>

<p>"Now don't you begin to be mysterious,
Ruth, if she don't, whose does she trust?"</p>

<p>"The Lord's."</p>

<p>"Oh!" and Guy had no more to say.
Agnes could have embraced her sister then.
She wanted to say something to Guy about
Ruth, because she knew her better than even
he or any one could know her. But he was
so silent now, perhaps this was not the best
time. Guy ate a little, Agnes thought, and
she did not feel so hungry after all; so
when Ruth had finished she said: "Let me
wash the tea things myself to night, Ruth, I
have not been doing anything all day. I will
be ready in time for church." She plead as
eagerly as if asking a great favor, and Ruth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
amused at her childishness, with a warning
about not placing the glasses in too hot water,
ran up stairs, little thinking of the effect
her words had either upon the one for whom
they were spoken, or the one to whom they
were addressed.</p>

<p>"If we had Martha Nelson, she could do
so much for Ruth when I am at school,"
thought Agnes. "But the money, where is
that to come from?" Turning it over and
over in her mind, she could see no possibility
of having Martha, but somehow there
was an impression that Martha should be
with them. On the way to church, she decided
to speak to Ruth about it.</p>

<p>"Did you ever have impressions that certain
things <i>should</i> be, Ruth, and yet the
things seemed impossible?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely understand you," Ruth replied.
"What kind of things? spiritual?"</p>

<p>"No, spiritual impressions of temporal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
things, I suppose. But this is why I ask."
Then she told of Martha's mother wanting
to find a place for her, and of the impression
amounting almost to a conviction that she
was to come to them. "Only I can't see
where the money is to come from."</p>

<p>"How much does her mother want a
week?" asked Ruth, thoughtfully; for
when Agnes had these impressions, they generally
had weight with her sister. Indeed
she sometimes felt as if the Lord told their
Agnes more than almost any other Christian;
that she was peculiarly favored of God.</p>

<p>"I did not think of asking her, but it can't
be much, for she is young and will require to
be taught. Why do you ask, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know; perhaps if she did not
want much, we could take her."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall ask her mother without
giving the reason, and then if it is best, the
way will be made clear."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>DEATH,&mdash;THEN LIFE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/m.png" width="146" height="200" alt="M" title="M" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />RS. Nelson will be willing to let
Martha go to a good home for her
board and clothing until she learns
enough to be entitled to wages, Ruth," Agnes
joyfully announced. After a little consultation
as to whether their old dresses could be
cut down for her, and some misgiving on the
part of Ruth as to the training of such a
mere child, when neither of them could devote
much time to her, they concluded to
make the trial.</div>

<p>"If she's worth anything she will be worth
a great deal to me just now, for it will enable
me to do what I have long been planning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
without seeing any way to accomplish it,"
thought Ruth.</p>

<p>Martha, poor child, in her great joy at the
thought of living with "Miss Agnes,"
seemed to have forgotten the painful circumstance
which compelled her to leave home.
But on the day that her mother finished
patching her few clothes, tying them up and
telling her she might go at once to her new
home, there came sad tidings from the hospital.
They need never hope to have the
husband and father home again, unless to
take one last look before they buried him
out of sight.</p>

<p>"Let me stay with you, mother; Miss
Agnes will not be angry, and you will be so
lonely," plead the child, forgetting everything
else in the one great thought of her
mother's approaching widowhood.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will be lonely," wailed the
mother. "God only knows the loneliness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and heart-ache that is in store for me. But
we'll not shed tears now, child, there'll be
time enough by and by. We must away to
to see him; he'll have a word to say to us
I'm thinking."</p>

<p>She meant to be brave, and to keep back
the tears until "by and by," but the thought
of hearing the last words, perhaps, or what
was worse, finding him unable to speak to
her, completely unnerved her, and the
strength she had all along tried to keep for
her children's sake, failed her. In the midst
of this scene, while Martha stood beside her
mother, wringing her hands and beseeching
her not to groan so, Agnes stepped in, having
had but one session of school.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she enquired, alarmed.
"Your father is not dead, Martha?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, they sent word that he
was dying, and we are going to him. Won't
you go, Miss Agnes? I am afraid," and the
child shuddered as she spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>A shudder passed through Agnes, but she
said: "Yes, I will go with you, but I must
find some of the scholars to send home and
tell Miss Ruth." She thought with horror
of going there to the hospital, where men and
women were lying struggling for life, to be
followed by their wild, staring eyes, and their
cries of entreaty for relief. For a moment
she was possessed with the feeling that she
could not encounter the fearful sight, and
the question arose: "Why need I cause myself
to suffer when I cannot relieve the sufferings
I shall witness?" But ashamed of
her cowardice, she banished the thought as
unworthy a place in her heart, glad to be
able to share the sorrows and help to comfort
those whose time of trial and sore distress
had come.</p>

<p>"I shall need help one day, perhaps," she
said to herself, "if Ruth or Guy should be
taken first. But I pray God that I may die<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
before them, unless&mdash;" here the child-like-spirit
showed itself, and her soul became
suddenly strong&mdash;"it would be to His glory
that I should thus suffer."</p>

<p>A boy was sent with a message to Ruth,
and then, as Mrs. Nelson was ready, they set
out on their mournful visit. It was a long
and silent walk. The heart of the sorrow-stricken
woman was too full for words, and
Agnes, so young and unaccustomed to such
scenes, did not know what was best to say.</p>

<p>The hand that held Martha's tightened its
grasp as they came within sight of the hospital,
and although the voice was very low
that whispered in the woman's ear, "Be
strong, God will help you," it gave courage
and re-assurance.</p>

<p>Up the broad steps and through the long
corridors they passed; Martha trembling and
drawing closer, while Agnes dared not look
to the right or left. Presently they stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
before a curtained recess, and drawing aside
the curtain Mrs. Nelson passed in. Martha
wanted her teacher with her, she said; but
when she was told her father might have
things to say to his wife and child alone, she
withdrew her hand and followed her mother.
It was not long, however, until the nurse
came out with a request for Martha's teacher.</p>

<p>"He wants some singing, Miss, and the
little girl told him you could sing beautiful,"
said the man. As Agnes stepped near the
bedside, Martha called out eagerly, "Here
she is, father, this is Miss Agnes."</p>

<p>He tried to speak, but it was only a movement
of the lips, no sound came. Sitting
where he could see her, Agnes began in a
low, clear voice, to sing:</p>

<div class='center'>
"There is a fountain fill'd with blood,&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>When she came to the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And there may I, though vile as he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wash all my sins away,&mdash;"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>the dying man held out his hand as if beckoning
her over. Again his lips moved, and
stooping she heard: "Again&mdash;sing."</div>

<p>As her voice arose again, slowly repeating
the words, her heart made supplication for
the soul so rapidly passing away. Hymn
after hymn was sung, all speaking of Jesus
and his great love for sinners, and to Agnes
it seemed that Jesus was himself speaking
in each. She knew he was there in the
midst of them, and wondered if the sick man
saw him. Bending down, she whispered:
"O, how the Saviour loves you; do you
love Him?"</p>

<p>He looked at her with the strange, earnest
look the dying only have; the look that
seems to be measuring eternity; and then
his hands were raised and clasped, while his
eyes remained fixed on hers.</p>

<p>"He is asking you to pray," said the
nurse; "He is near gone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no time to listen to Satan now,
or to think of anything but this soul venturing
out into the unknown future. Was it
prepared?</p>

<p>O, how she plead for him! As if face to
face, she talked with God. The Holy Spirit
gave her words and great assurance; it
seemed as if the answer must come. He had
promised to hear and to give the things desired.
He had <i>never</i> refused to listen to the
feeblest petition, and here was a burdened
soul; was not the Saviour near, to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'take take'">take</ins>
from it its burdens? So she entreated as
though she alone could save him, yet knowing
well that Jesus alone had power to forgive
sins.</p>

<p>They had been sobbing around her, but
she did not know it. Now there was a
strange silence, a sudden calm, and she felt
that she had prevailed. As they rose from
their knees, something about the dying man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
attracted them. While they had been kneeling,
Jesus had drawn near and whispered to
him. The power and music of that voice
were ringing in his ear; the beauty of His
smile was flooding his soul and radiating his
face. In that moment he had passed from
death into life.</p>

<p>His wife and child looked at him with
awe; the nurse drew back as if the place
were too "holy ground" for him. Only
Agnes and the new-born soul understood it.
But it had only caught a glimpse of the Saviour;
before long, with the same indescribable
expression, it passed away to be "forever
with the Lord."</p>

<p>They went home silently as they had gone
there; but a new feeling had taken possession
of them. They had seen strange things;
new thoughts had been given them, and
death had not to them its old terror, for they
had seen it swallowed up in victory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>GUY GIVES HIS VIEWS IN FULL.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/m.png" width="146" height="200" alt="M" title="M" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ARTHA was fairly installed as kitchen-maid,
to the great delight of
Agnes, while Ruth congratulated
herself that there would be no more dishwashing
for her, a thing she detested above
all others. "She appears anxious to learn,
doesn't she?" asked Agnes. "She was a
good scholar and perfectly obedient. I think
you will like her, Ruth. If we gain her affections
I am sure she will do anything for
us."</div>

<p>"But then we must be careful, Agnes, it
does not answer to pay too much attention
to servants. They are sure to become consequential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and to value themselves too highly,
if you notice them much."</p>

<p>"But she is a child, and everything is
strange. Besides, when she thinks of her
father and of separation from her mother,
she must be sad, and perhaps may try your
patience. I shall help all I can, but she had
better look upon you as mistress. Be patient
for my sake, sister."</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, and Agnes
was afraid she had made a mistake in proposing
such a child, instead of one more fully
grown. That night after Martha had gone
to bed, she slipped up stairs to know if she
had repeated her prayers.</p>

<p>"O, yes, ma'am, I always say them; I
should be afraid to go to sleep if I did not."</p>

<p>"We have a great deal to thank God for,
Martha. Every day He cares for us, and it
is the least we can do to thank Him. Do
you thank Him for what you have, or only
ask to have more?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I ask most for the things I want.
I forget about thanking, only I mean it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and God sees that you mean it, but
He expects you to tell Him so. Now if I
were to give you a great many things every
day, and you did not thank me but were all
the time thinking of other things you desired
to have, I should call you ungrateful and not
give you any more. Don't you see how it
is? Now when you are praying, be sure to
ask not to be allowed to forget pleasing God,
by doing every thing as if He were here
looking at you. Are you warm enough
child?"</p>

<p>"O yes, ma'am, Miss Ruth came up and
tucked me in nicely, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"She kissed me and said 'good night.'"</p>

<p>Agnes's first impulse was to exclaim with
surprise; but checking herself she stooped
down, saying: "And I must follow Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Ruth's example, I suppose. Be a good girl,
Martha, and Miss Ruth and I will be your
friends."</p>

<p>"I need have no fears; Ruth could never
be anything but kind, although people so often
misunderstand her and think her stern.
She will never let generosity carry away her
sense of justice; and after all that is the better
way," thought Agnes, as she descended to
the sitting room. Guy was home that night.
As Agnes entered the room he laid down his
book with the remark: "I say, Agnes, brother
Snowden is considered the salt of the
earth among you church people, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he is a good man; I don't
know much about him. Why do you ask?"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, only that it strikes me <i>that</i> kind of
salt would not make very strong pickle."</p>

<p>"How you talk," said Ruth, "You know
nothing about his Christian life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, that is it, he has two lives has he?
Well, I admit that I know nothing about his
<i>Christian</i> life. But I do know about his business
life, if that is a separate and distinct
thing. When a Christian comes to me and
asks me to undertake a case that is simply
trickery and fraud, then I want to know how
he can separate himself from his profession
of religion. I thought religion had to run
through one's life, instead of hinging and
unhinging it when one chose. I know one
thing, that some of your church members
dabble in puddles so dirty that I would not
touch them with the tip of my finger, and
this Snowden is one of them."</p>

<p>"I would not judge the many by one," replied
Agnes, quietly.</p>

<p>"No, that is a wholesale way of speaking,"
said her sister, positively. "And you
may not have understood the man, Guy;
and you know you are rather hasty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here, Ruth, don't you begin to take
sides with that fellow. Agnes is bound to
defend him, because he is a goat of the same
fold. But you may be glad you slipped out,
backslid is the word I believe, for it is no
honor to have the association of such a contemptible
specimen of mankind."</p>

<p>Ruth's face flushed and her eye kindled at
his allusion to her backsliding, but she did
not speak, while Agnes, who was deeply
pained at his unkind speech, immediately replied:
"You are wrong, Guy, Ruth is a
church member, the same as I. And while
neither of us can endorse what is done by
every member of the church, we know there
are good, earnest Christians there, and it is
not for us to sit in judgment upon any."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he exclaimed. "This is most
animating. It is a pity you were not a man,
you would make a capital advocate. But
excuse me, I forget, we have ladies in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
profession. If you have no objection to
reading with me, I shall be proud to present
to the bar such an able pleader."</p>

<p>This was just what Agnes wanted, to
have the conversation turned. So that Ruth
and the church escaped, she did not care
what was said of her. For fear of Guy returning
to the old subject, she inquired
whether he thought women could ever attain
any eminence in the profession.</p>

<p>"Yes, the fact of them being women will
not mentally disqualify them," he replied.
"As a general thing they are clear sighted,
and although not always logical, have a way
of carrying their point in spite of all opposition.
To office work some might be well
adapted, but when it comes to practise at
the bar, to get up and harangue a crowded
court-room; to be brought in contact with
low characters and take any part in criminal
proceedings, then I say a woman is out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
place. When they take that stand I shall
step aside and let them glory in their
shame."</p>

<p>Guy spoke with great warmth. Ruth appeared
to be listening attentively, though
she did not speak. Encouraged by the interest
manifested by his sisters, Guy Gorton
Esq., Attorney at Law, was in the act of giving
a fuller expression of his views, and by
his <i>logical</i> reasoning, determining woman's
position for all time, when the door-bell rang
and Martha ushered in visitors.</p>

<p>To Ruth it was a happy relief, for though
she had appeared to manifest interest, very
painful thoughts were passing through her
mind. She had made a great sacrifice for
Guy in hope of doing him good, how great,
no one knew, and yet withall she had failed
in her object. He looked at her as the world
always judges of Christians; not by profession
but practise. However, it may sneer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and cavil at doctrine, the world is not slow
to recognize and respect the character that
like pure gold carries with it not only beauty
but sterling worth.</p>

<p>"Bartered my Christian character," she
thought, "and what have I in exchange?
Complete failure, dead loss;" and all through
the evening, though she talked and laughed,
the question and answer came up before her.</p>

<p>When their friends had gone and the girls
went up to their room, each sat down on her
favorite seat as if for a talk. With Agnes it
was the foot of the bed, having the low post
on which to lean, while Ruth took the low
rocking-chair. The thoughts of both ran in
the same direction, but neither seemed inclined
to break the silence. Agnes would
have spoken, but Ruth was sensitive, and
any allusion to the subject might pain her.
Suddenly she said, "What a lovely character
Edith Hart was, Ruth. Her manners are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
charming, and she is perfectly sincere, I am
sure. Did you notice what difference Guy
paid to her opinions and how much he
seemed to admire her? I wish he would fall
in love with her and marry her, for of course
he will marry some one, and she would have
such a good influence over him."</p>

<p>"Yes, when they were married she might,
if he in the meantime had not exerted a
wrong influence over her. It must require
a great deal of grace to maintain your Christian
integrity, when those you love are worldly
minded. I don't think Edith would hold
out any better than the rest of us, if she
loved Guy as she should. But there is no
use in talking about that, it will be a long
time before Guy can marry."</p>

<p>"Why, his practise is improving, isn't it?
I often hear him talk of his clients, and you
know lawyers charge very high for advice.
I don't know where I heard it, but I am of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the impression that they will not give the
least bit of advice under five dollars. At
that rate, you know, he will make out well."</p>

<p>Ruth wanted to laugh at her sister's simplicity.
Do as she would, she never could
teach Agnes the value of money. And now,
poor child, she seemed to think Guy had
nothing to do but open his mouth and gold
dollars would roll out, as diamonds did in
the wonderful story of "Toads and Diamonds."
In one way she was glad that
Agnes knew so little about money matters;
she wanted to save her from care or anxiety.
But there were times when she was so perplexed
and straitened, that it made her impatient
to think any grown person could be
so stupid as to live in their house and not
more fully understand their circumstances.
At such times she murmured and even rebelled,
wondering why she should have all
the burden. It did not reconcile her to it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to know that others admired and deferred to
her judgment. She grew tired of thinking
and planning, and longed for a strength
greater than her own, upon which she could
lean, for some one to help her bear the burdens.
This was not sentiment. If the
thought of marriage came to her as it probably
did, especially at such times, she put it
far from her. She would never leave Guy
and Agnes; but if they only had been constituted
differently, they could have helped
her. And they in turn, little dreaming of
her struggles, looked at her with admiring
eyes, giving her credit, as far as they could
follow her, and thinking what a wonderful
woman their Ruth was.</p>

<p>"But it is slow work after all," she said,
by way of reply to her sister's remarks. "A
man must possess great talent and still greater
patience and perseverance, to arrive at any
distinction; and until he reaches that, he cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
expect to make his fortune. There are
so many young lawyers, they are crowding
each other out."</p>

<p>"But Guy must be satisfied, Ruth; he
does not appear troubled or disappointed."</p>

<p>"Why should he? he is like hundreds
more, and that fact is consoling. Besides,
the slower and more cautious he is in the
ascent, the more assured will he be when
he reaches the summit."</p>

<p>She rose as she said this, and Agnes
thinking the talk was over, removed her
arms from the friendly bed-post. But she
had only gone over to the bureau for her Bible,
that she might read a chapter as usual
before retiring. Returning to her seat she
abruptly asked: "Do you think much about
the future, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean about heaven?"</p>

<p>"No, the future of time."</p>

<p>"Not nearly as much as I used to. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
my heart was renewed, I kept looking to the
future for something satisfying; but it never
came until I found the Saviour."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I mean do you wonder what
your life is to be, and what changes will
come to us all?"</p>

<p>"O, often such thoughts come, but they
are disquieting, and I drive them away. It
is better to live by the moment, just as we
breathe."</p>

<p>Ruth opened her book and began to read.
Her eye having fallen on the last verse of the
sixth chapter of Matthew, it had called forth
the above question. Now she read it all
carefully; it was just what she needed to-night.
Dissatisfied with herself, and feeling
that she was not satisfying others, she wanted
to find the rest that comes from leaving
everything in a Father's hands, but she was
yet to find the spirit of trust and submission.</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S ASSOCIATION.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 122px;">
<img src="images/r.png" width="122" height="200" alt="R" title="R" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />IPLEY, like most towns of its size,
possessed few novelties, and rarely
produced a sensation. It did its duty
in the way of gossip, as towns and villages
are expected to do. Carrying out, in a manner
peculiar to some, the injunction of the
apostle: "Look not every man on his own
things, but every man also on the things of
others." When the Rev. John Jay was
called to the Fourth street church, the whole
town partook of the excitement, for he was a
young and single man; moreover, he came
from a distant city, with the strongest recommendation.
He had been there about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
year, when the community were again
aroused to a high pitch of expectancy, by
the following announcement one Sabbath
morning: "The Official Board of this church
will hold a special meeting at the close of
the Wednesday night prayer meeting. A
full attendance is requested as a matter of
grave moment is to be presented."</div>

<p>As the minister made this announcement,
he fervently wished they would always attend
to business after prayer-meeting. He
would not then have to refer so often to that
means of grace, for the Fourth street brethren
looked well to the temporal interests of their
church.</p>

<p>He did not see the nod given by brother
Smith to brother Snowden, which said:&mdash;"I
told you it was a comin'; now you'll believe
me;" nor the succession of nods in return,
which indicated:&mdash;"Well, to think of it.
After that I give up." Neither did he overtake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the group of officials who slowly wended
their way homeward in earnest discussion,
shaking their heads, and trying to give
greater force to their words by an energetic
movement of the hand and arm.</p>

<p>He was picking his steps as best he could
through a crowd of children, who were darting
here and there, looking up at him with
beaming eyes, and trying to touch his hands
at least, if they could not hold them. As he
looked at these lambs, he wondered if there
could be love for the Saviour in any heart
which did not make the young a special care.
After he had parted from them, two little
feet came tripping back to remind him of
his promise that he would finish the story of
Moses in the afternoon. He went home
thanking God for the innocence of childhood,
while with their noon-day meal many of
of these children partook of poison administered
by their parents. For what else is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
fault-finding, intolerance and uncharitableness,
but the deadliest poison?</p>

<p>And what gave rise to this, was simply
that the young people of the church and community
wanted to organize a Young People's
Association, at the suggestion of their pastor,
and wished the privilege of holding it in the
Lecture-room. The thing was projected so
suddenly, that very few of the older members
knew anything about it until it was
brought to their notice in this manner.</p>

<p>When the hour for the evening service arrived,
there were few who had not heard the
news; for brother Smith and brother Snowden
considered it a good Sabbath day's work
to discuss the matter in all its bearings with
all the members they could meet, although
they did not doubt but the women folks
would be sure to side with the young people.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night the Lecture-room
was crowded. Those whose faces were seldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
seen in the Lord's house, and many of
the brethren who always found it extremely
inconvenient to attend on that night, were
there. Of course, none but the Board could
remain, for the meeting, but the others could
hover round and catch the news much sooner
than if they had staid at home.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Jay drew very near to
Christ in presenting his flock, and most earnestly
prayed for the young of the congregation
and community, many of whom he saw
there for the first time. As he prayed,
brother Smith and Snowden were loud in
their responses.</p>

<p>Those who went to meet the master of assemblies,
felt it good to be there. Unto
them had been broken the bread of life.
Unto them a well-known voice had spoken,
and now they were stronger, braver and
more hopeful. When the minister, with uplifted
hands, pronounced the words of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
benediction, like the gentle dew, fell that
peace into their hearts, drawing them out in
tenderest sympathy toward all His creatures.</p>

<p>After it had been ascertained that there
were no intruders, and the doors had been
carefully closed, the business commenced.
Prayer was dispensed with, for there had
been so much of it before.</p>

<p>"I move we dispense with everything but
the business in hand," said one, and as the
meeting concurred, the petition was presented
by one of the most promising young men
of the church, named Hayes. In it the petitioners
set forth that they, feeling the need
of proper social entertainment and mental
improvement, wished to organize for that
purpose, and most respectfully asked the use
of the Lecture-room.</p>

<p>The secretary had no sooner uttered the
last sentence, than brother Smith arose and
protested against any such desecration of the
Lord's temple.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Social entertainment! What did that
mean, but a parcel of boys and girls without
a speck of grace in their hearts, wantin' a
good courtin'-place where their father's and
mother's wouldn't see them. For his part,
no child of his should join them.</p>

<p>"There's carryin's on enough under our
very noses, in the hearin' of the word without
givin' any more license," he continued,
waxing warmer.</p>

<p>"That's so," said brother Snowden, and
one or two others grunted an assent.</p>

<p>Then the young man named Hayes arose
and calmly said: "It is well known that the
young seek enjoyment. Their minds are
fresh and active; they will turn in one direction
or another. We cannot control
them; we can only seek to guide them.
Many of our young are going to ruin, because
there are no well directed efforts put forth
to meet the wants of their impulsive natures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The world offers to gratify them. It stretches
out its arms and says: 'Come to me. I
have pleasures for all at my command.'
And already many have turned and accepted
the proffered good. We Christians groan
over these and talk of their final doom; yet
what do we offer those, whose eager, hungry
natures cry out to us for bread?</p>

<p>"We say, 'Go to church on the Sabbath,
and to prayer-meeting; that is well; but
they want more than this and so do we.
That will do for the spiritual part of our nature.
But there is a social and intellectual
part which must be cared for. And let me
tell you, brethren, until the church makes
provision for every want of the young, it can
never gain a proper hold upon them.</p>

<p>"It is not for me to stand here as the teacher
of those older and wiser than I. But it
seems to me if we had the Apostle Paul here,
he would define our duty in broader and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
more decided terms. And still a greater
than Paul says: 'What man is there of you,
whom if his son ask bread will he give him
a stone?' That question applies to every
want of the being. How are you going to
answer it to-night? I charge you not to
close your doors upon those who knock, lest,
if the gate of heaven closes upon them, you
be found not guiltless."</p>

<p>These pointed words evidently made a
good impression, and the opposition had not
courage to oppose farther. Several of the
brethren, men whose hearts were under divine
control, and whose lives were devoted
to the advancement of the Master's cause, in
a few words endorsed the remarks, and when
the question was called for, there was but
one side, the opposition not voting.</p>

<p>When the young people were called together,
there was quite a large gathering.
Rev. John Jay was unanimously elected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
President, and Mr. Hayes, Secretary. But
now the great difficulty was, to obtain members.
All at once, these young men and
women, the latter especially, became conscious
of their ignorance, and dreaded its
exposure, for the public Library of Ripley,
was not very extensive or attractive. Its old
volumes of Theology, its Annals and Histories,
had been too heavy matter for youthful
digestion, and as a majority of the young
women did not consider it necessary to know
anything of the affairs of the nation, or to
possess any knowledge of the world outside
of their own town, they had been content to
glean from the newspapers, to note the deaths
and marriages, watch for some new recipe in
cookery, or the love-stories as they appeared
each week.</p>

<p>After a great deal of difficulty, twenty signatures
were obtained, with the understanding
that the young ladies in preparing their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
essays, were not expected to read them or
make public their names. Every thing at
first, until the members acquired more confidence,
was to be voluntary. After the business
of the evening had been transacted, a
call was made for contributions.</p>

<p>This was at once responded to by the principal
clerk in the principal grocery store, he
giving them in loud and thundering tones:
"The Star Spangled Banner." So grandly
did he render it, especially the "bombs
bursting in air," that one young lady covered
her face to shut out the view of the descending
bombs, and the President was compelled
to move aside, to prevent, if not the
deadly missiles, the bodily weight of the
speaker from descending upon him.</p>

<p>Loud applause greeted him at its conclusion,
and but for the hint given by the President
that it was time to close, they would
have been favored with another brilliant display.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The general opinion expressed by
those having any knowledge of theatricals
was, that it was "almost as good as a play,"
and the orator of the evening was overwhelmed
with compliments. After this, there
was little difficulty in obtaining members;
indeed the young clerk the very next day
succeeded in getting fifteen, so that by the
following meeting night, there was a large
and expectant assemblage. The young
grocer held forth of course, and several
others were so stirred with patriotism that
Fourth of July orations and patriotic speeches
followed each other in close succession.
With a great deal of persuasion, a few ladies
were prevailed upon to sing, and thinking
the music should correspond with the addresses,
they were about to give Hail Columbia,
when the President suggested that something
else by way of variety would be acceptable
to the audience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Old Arm Chair" was substituted
and gave general satisfaction. Even old
brother Sneddinly, who with a few others
was at a side door listening, declared that
anything that brought the Bible into it, must
have been written by a Christian; and if it
wasn't in the Hymn Book, it went pretty
near as slow and solemn as some of the
hymns. The latter assertion could not be
contradicted by his companions, and they even
went so far as to congratulate the pastor on
his success in getting up "so big an affair."
"Suppose you add still further to its success
by your presence and assistance," he suggested
with a smile; "we need some wise
and clear heads among us."</p>

<p>But that thought could not be entertained
for a moment by the brethren. "How would
it look for them to be mixing in with a parcel
of young folks, most of whom made no show
whatever of religion? O no, that would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
too great a compromise! There ought to be
a strict line drawn between the world and
Christians."</p>

<p>"Isn't there danger of drawing it so tight
that we will cut them off from us entirely?"
asked the pastor.</p>

<p>"No fear of that," was the reply, "if it
is held tight at one end, the other end will
be loose enough to slip them through."</p>

<p>"Thank God," said the Rev. John Jay,
mentally; "there shall be no tightening or
straining at this end!"</p>

<p>The Association soon became the all-absorbing
topic of the place. The young
people discussed it, and the old people discussed
it. It was destined to become a grand
success, the Rev. John Jay thought, as he
saw denominational prejudices give way and
the young people of the different churches
unite to help one another and be helped.
Yet there was one drawback; some of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
for whom he was most anxious, whose feet
had begun to travel the downward road; the
children of those who professed to be God's
children, were never seen there. His soul
was troubled. He knew at whose door the
fault lay, yet what could he do? He was
young and inexperienced. These men and
women, parents of the prodigal ones were
older than he. Should he show them the
fearful mistake they were making in condemning
everything that was not purely a
religious worship? Should he tell them by
reason of their sternness and their narrow
prejudices, which seemed more to them than
the souls of their children, they were driving
their children away from them and from
God? Would they bear this from him, even
though as Christ's ambassador he were to
speak? He was exceedingly doubtful; perhaps
they might dismiss him. Wouldn't it
be better for him to remain and watch over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
these wayward ones, showing them that he
knew the weakness of human nature and
the unquenchable ardor of youth? He concluded
to try it. He would make that his
one great work; he would win them to
Christ. With a heart somewhat lightened,
he gave himself out more fully in loving
words to the young, and entered more earnestly
into every plan suggested to make the
association an attraction. But just as he
was seeing the good results here, in another
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dirction'">direction</ins> the storm was gathering. He saw
it in the black looks and averted eyes of
many of the officials and even of their wives,
but as yet its mutterings had not reached his
ear.</p>

<p>Some to whom he had endeared himself
heard, and were fiercely indignant that such
a sweet, Christ-like spirit, as their pastor's,
should suffer pain through such allusions.</p>

<p>Just the very thing he had labored to accomplish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was that which was to testify
against him. Many young hearts had been
drawn nearer to Christ through him, and
their voices were heard in the songs of praise
which went up from that little prayer-circle
on Wednesday night. But these pious men
and women, although rarely ever present
themselves, saw nothing in which to rejoice.
On the contrary, they mourned over the
weakness of one, who by virtue of his sacred
office, should be far removed from such
things. Wasn't it too evident that the
young women went to church to see the
young pastor, and the young men to see the
young women? It was time such things
were stopped; they were a shame and disgrace
to a church.</p>

<p>In the meantime the society was flourishing,
a new element had been brought into
it, and so far as its literary character was
concerned, the most sanguine expectations
of the Rev. John Jay had been met.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Several public meetings had been held,
filling the house to overflowing, and eliciting
the highest and most deserving praise. But
that was of course from outsiders, and those
simple-minded souls in the church, who never
see evil without looking for good; who indeed
are always finding the latter in everything
and in every one but themselves.
These were not competent judges. "Had
the church been left to them, where would
have been its sacredness and sanctity?
Why, they never even changed their voices
in the Lord's house, and they even wore a
smile while there, as if they had forgotten
the Lord was in his holy temple."</p>

<p>Thank God, there are those who carry His
image about wherever they go! Such need
not by their own effort show a conscienceness
of His presence. He is the continual
light of their countenance, and the gladness
and music he makes in their hearts, is heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in their voice. They worship and praise
with every breath, because their souls must
find an outlet to the great love which holds
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'VIII'">IX</ins>.</h2>

<h3>A DAY OF PLEASURE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 92px;">
<img src="images/i.png" width="92" height="200" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />T was an unusually warm day in June,
and Ruth had dismissed her scholars
early on that account. She stood by
the window plucking the dried leaves off the
climbing rose, and thinking how delightful
the approaching vacation would be, when a
little hand touched her. Looking down she
found Philip by her side.</div>

<p>"And what will mamma say at having no
little boy at home?" she asked, drawing him
nearer, and smoothing back his wavy hair.</p>

<p>"O, mamma knows. She only said I
must not trouble you. I guess I wouldn't
do that, though, because I love you too
much."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the little hand tried to give Ruth's
a great squeeze, while such an effort brought
color to the pale cheeks. Not only that, but
it brought something he wanted very much,
a kiss.</p>

<p>"You always kiss me for telling you that,
Miss Ruth, and so does mamma. What do
you do it for? Do you like little boys to
love you?"</p>

<p>"You have not told me how much you
love me," was the laughing reply. "I cannot
answer questions till I know all about
them."</p>

<p>"O, I love you more than all the world,
except my mamma;&mdash;isn't that <i>ever</i> so
much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a great deal. Then you
don't love any one but your mamma and
me?"</p>

<p>"I love God," and the earnest eyes were
fixed on the blue clouds. "Would you like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to be up there, Miss Ruth? Mamma reads
about it for me. I should like to go up
there and see it. I should like to see God,
too, but I would come back again, you
know. Mamma always cries and hugs me
when I say that; just as if I would stay
away from mamma and you. I guess I
wouldn't. But I would see all the beautiful
things the Bible says are there, and then I
would draw pretty pictures. Mamma says
there is a house up there for us all, and some
day we will go and stay there. Do you want
to go, Miss Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some day," she replied; but there
was no kindling of the eye, no joy of soul at
the thought, for Ruth knew that her earthly
love was stronger and more absorbing than
the heavenly. "There, now, we will go and
see about Miss Agnes's dinner," she added,
glad to divert his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Miss Agnes has not come, Martha?" she
inquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I have been watching for
her. She will be awful hot, I think."</p>

<p>"You are Miss Agnes's little girl, and I
am Miss Ruth's little boy, aren't we?" asked
the child.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Ruth's, too," said Martha,
decidedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you love Miss Agnes best."</p>

<p>"I love both just the same&mdash;only different;
but Miss Agnes was my teacher."</p>

<p>Ruth gave such a quick look, that the
child drew back frightened, thinking she
was angry; but she smiled at her, and Martha's
fear left her. How much a smile will
do, and what a very little word or act will
bring that smile. So when Agnes came
home "awful hot," as Martha said, she was
met by smiling faces, and waited on by loving
hands, and finally it ended in a "real
party," for they all had strawberries and
cream, to keep Miss Agnes company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't he a darling," whispered Agnes,
glancing toward Philip, who was intent on
his strawberries.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a remarkable child; his mother
must be very fond of him. I have been
planning something to-day, Agnes, for all
hands," looking round at the children, as
she spoke.</p>

<p>"What?" asked her sister, brightening.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you until we are alone. But
it will bring the roses to somebody's cheeks,
and be very nice for all the somebodies."</p>

<p>"Don't let us do any thing this afternoon,
but talk or read," proposed Agnes; and
hearing this, Philip hurried to the school-room
for his own little chair, so that he
might lay his head on Ruth's lap and listen.
But <i>Christus Consolator</i> was too profound,
and lulled by the sound of Agnes's sweet
voice, and Ruth's caressing touch, he slept.</p>

<p>"When the sun goes down it is time for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
little birds to be in their nests," said Ruth,
and Philip now wide awake and knowing
what was to follow, ran to tell Martha to get
her hat. The first time he had staid, Ruth
sent word to his mother that she would take
him home, and ever since it had been understood.</p>

<p>"One on one side, and one on the other,"
he said, as he placed himself between Ruth
and Agnes, offering a hand to each. But
Ruth asked what was to become of poor
Martha, and soon the two children were
talking as gravely, and looking as demurely
side by side, as if they had been grandfather
and grandmother.</p>

<p>On their way home, while Martha walked
before, Ruth developed her idea, which was
that they should have a pic-nic, perhaps several
of them during vacation, "as it would
be so expensive to go away for a length
of time you know. Just a family affair,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
she continued, "and we will take the children
along to enliven us."</p>

<p>Agnes fell in with the plan very readily,
and pictures of ferns, mosses and lichens at
once rose before her delighted vision.</p>

<p>There were trying days still to be passed
in the school-room, days on which Ruth felt
it would be a relief to scream out or do something
desperate. But when she looked at
the little ones under her care, trying to be
good and obedient while under control, she
chided herself for her impatience, at the
same time relaxing her discipline. But the
days went by and the holidays came, and
Miss Ruth's joy at her freedom was not one
bit less than her pupils'; though she didn't
run screaming to tell every one that "school
was broken up." "We might as well go
soon, Ruth. I feel as if I could scarcely
breathe here," said Agnes, a few days after
school had closed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"A day won't help you much if you are in
that state. What shall you do all the other
warm days?"</p>

<p>"Imagine I am in the woods," was the
laughing reply.</p>

<p>"Then you had better bring your imagination
to bear upon it now. Guy will have
to dine down town that day. I fancy he
will not like it very well, for he is so fastidious.
Guy was certainly meant to be rich."</p>

<p>"Why not ask him to go with us?" suggested
Agnes.</p>

<p>"If you want to be laughed at you will.
Imagine our Guy going with two women,
two children, and a lot of baskets, to spend
a day in the woods!"</p>

<p>"I should think he might enjoy the
change quite as much as we. But men are
queer, they look upon women's pleasures as
childish, I really believe."</p>

<p>The day before the pic-nic every one was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
busy; even Philip insisted upon helping.
When Guy came to dinner there was such an
air of commotion that he at once inquired
the cause.</p>

<p>"What's up, girls? house-cleaning? If
that's the case, I'm off; no soap-suds and
white-wash for me."</p>

<p>"Hear him; house-cleaning in July!"
exclaimed Agnes.</p>

<p>"I do believe, Guy, you men would never
do a bit of cleaning all your lives, if you were
house keepers."</p>

<p>"You may bet on that," was the reply.
"That is just where we would show our
good sense."</p>

<p>"Your filthy habits, you mean."</p>

<p>"Well, either, whichever suits you. But
you haven't said what was in the wind."</p>

<p>"None came this way to-day, we could
not tell."</p>

<p>"We are going to close the house to-morrow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Guy, so you need not come home to
dinner. We intend going to the woods to
find fresh air."</p>

<p>But Guy didn't like the idea; it sounded
common, he thought. Every day he met a
lot of women and their babies, with a parcel
of brats following them, going over the river
or somewhere. "Why can't you take a week
each of you, and go to the country like other
people?"</p>

<p>That, "like other people," was too much
for Ruth, and she said, sharply: "We can't
be what we are not. Beggars must not be
choosers."</p>

<p>Guy replied in as sharp a tone that "some
people liked to make a parade of their poverty,"
and finished his dinner in silence.
This unfortunate affair threw a damper over
the girls, but the children did not come
within the shadow of the cloud. Ruth had
a sudden angry impulse not to go at all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
scarcely knowing why, as it would not spite
her brother. But she could not yield to
such a thought when the happiness of Agnes
and the children was to be considered.</p>

<p>Agnes spoke very little after the occurrence,
knowing what state of mind Ruth
was in, but she sang in a low voice some
of her sister's favorite hymns, and in a little
while the cloud rolled away, the sun came
out, and the storm was all over. By tea-time
Guy and Ruth were as if nothing unpleasant
had happened, but there was no
allusion made to the pic-nic.</p>

<p>"I wonder how people feel who are going
on an extended tour," said Agnes, as they
filled their lunch baskets.</p>

<p>"That depends very much upon the people
themselves," replied Ruth. "This little
trip is giving us more real pleasure than
some people would know in travelling all
over the globe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so; it is the appreciation
that is needed, and without that there can
be no enjoyments."</p>

<p>Fortunately, for Guy, he did not see the
party set out the next morning, or the shock
might so completely have overcome him as
to unfit him for any business whatever.
But they waited until he had gone, and
then they started with their baskets, trowel,
and garden-fork.</p>

<p>"People will take us for herb-gatherers,
and think these are our children," said Agnes,
gaily.</p>

<p>"Shocking!" exclaimed Ruth, with mock
earnestness.</p>

<p>They took the boat for several miles down
the river, to the great delight of the children,
especially Philip, whose keen eyes
took in the smallest white speck of a sail,
and then when they had climbed a very
little hill, and gone down a big one, they
were in the woods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a delightful perfume! Isn't it
charming!" exclaimed Agnes, delightedly,
as she sat down by a tree to "enjoy herself."
But the children who had been scampering
about, declared there was a much
nicer place not far off, and so Miss Agnes,
who could imagine no scene more charming,
very reluctantly consented to tear herself
away.</p>

<p>The spot chosen by the children was indeed
lovely. Perfectly level ground covered
with the richest moss, out of which
rose broad flat rocks, and along side of
which, not many yards distant, ran a clear
little stream on whose banks the feathery
fern grew, and into which it dipped its
graceful frond. On the other side of the
stream the wood was more dense, but
through it a broad path led to a bend in the
river.</p>

<p>"We need go no farther," exclaimed both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Ruth and Agnes. "Nothing could exceed
this for loveliness and shade.</p>

<p>"By the river of Babylon there we sat
down," and Agnes once more settled herself.</p>

<p>"There we hung our harps upon the willows,"
added Ruth, throwing her shawl on
a branch overhead. "Now, Agnes, let us
take it easy and make the most of the day,
for such days will be like angel's visits."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we rest first. Methinks
I could forget myself in sleep."</p>

<p>Presently Ruth was accosted with, "I
think I know now what I should do if I
were rich."</p>

<p>"What?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Take sick people into the country.
That is, if I could afford to keep a carriage.
I have been thinking about it since yesterday."</p>

<p>Ruth knew what had brought it to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mind. Guy's picture of the women and
their babies; sick, of course.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Many of those who
die every year might become strong and
well again, if they could be taken from the
close, stifling air of their wretched homes
into that which is pure and fresh."</p>

<p>"Nothing could give greater pleasure than
to have these poor, emaciated babies and
wan-faced women look up at you with a
smile, as if saying, 'O how this cheers us.'
I wonder if it will ever be?"</p>

<p>"'Tis hard to tell," was the reply. "But
suppose you had a carriage, your husband
might object to your using it in this way."</p>

<p>"Then I should not use it at all." Here
Agnes looked as if at that time rejecting its
use.</p>

<p>Ruth laughed. "Wait, my dear, until
you get it," she said. "Or before you give
yourself away, it would be well to ask the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
gentleman, if, in case you owned such a
thing, you could use it for such purposes."</p>

<p>"Not I indeed. No man ever finds me
asking him such a question; what was <i>his</i>
would be mine. But I shall know, when I
see the man, what manner of spirit he is
of."</p>

<p>This occasioned another laugh, in which
Agnes joined, and the two, banishing the
thoughts of sick babies and pale-faced
women, had a gay time. In the meantime,
the children had scrambled over rocks to
gather lichen, and dug holes deep enough to
bury a kitten in, in their efforts to get moss;
they had sailed little nut-shell boats down
the stream, and in the many ways that children
have enjoyed themselves. Everybody
was hungry of course, so by the time Agnes
was ready for her ferns, there were empty
baskets in which to place them. But they
read and talked before that, and walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
through the woods on the other side out to
the river, finding several beautiful plants on
their way. Then at the last the ferns were
gathered, and Agnes did wish they could
have had more baskets. But Ruth informed
her she might have gone home by herself if
she had.</p>

<p>"Now that is my idea of enjoying oneself,"
said Agnes, as tired but very happy,
she laid her head on her pillow.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is rational, sensible enjoyment,"
replied Ruth. "I wish sensible people
would have the moral courage to act
sensibly in this matter of rest and recreation.
But it would shock a great many
quite as much as it did Guy. Now I think
it is well and often necessary for persons to
have a more decided change, when their
health requires it, and their means will
allow. But this thing of going to fashionable
resorts, for the sake of appearance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
spending hundreds of dollars in mere dissipation;
coming home envious and dissatisfied
at the greater show made by others,
instead of seeking change for the good of it,
at the same time having their hearts drawn
out after those less fortunate, is to me one
of the greatest evils of the day."</p>

said Ruth, after several old
dresses had been cut down and
made over for Martha. "She knows so
well how to manage, and has patterns of the
styles. With our help she can accomplish a
great deal in a few days."</div>

<p>"Do you think we can get new dresses
this Fall? We have worn these faithfully,
you know?" inquired Agnes, as she examined
and re-examined her suites.</p>

<p>"Not for some time, I fear; it takes a
great deal to keep up a house these times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
But it does not seem fair that you should
give your money to me, Agnes. In future
you had better keep what remains after
paying for your board. It is not right to
have you work hard and get so few clothes."</p>

<p>"Do you get any more, and haven't I as
good a right to do without things as you?"</p>

<p>"No, it is different. I keep the house,
and perhaps things are not managed well. I
don't know. I get bewildered at times to
know which is the best way. But now that
we have Martha and she understands her
work so well, I intend to give music lessons
this Fall. That will be a great help."</p>

<p>"And yet, when you think <i>you</i> ought to
do this, you want <i>me</i> to keep money from
the house, so that I may have new dresses
when I choose. O, Ruth, could you think
me so selfish!"</p>

<p>"It would not be selfish, it would be
right," urged her sister. But she could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
bear to tell Agnes that if it were not for
Guy they might both dress differently. He
had come to her repeatedly for money to
help him out of difficulty, and now he said
there was no manner of use in attempting to
do business up three flights of stairs; he
must have a ground floor, and of course that
would involve greater expense.</p>

<p>"If you could only manage to start me in
this, Ruth," he had said, "there is no reason
why I should not succeed. These one-horse
affairs are always failures. I will pay you
back again when money comes in you may be
sure, as there is no doubt it will."</p>

<p>Then Ruth, who could not resist such
pleading, told him to make the change and
she would help him out with his rent, resolving
then and there to do extra work in order
to meet the demands upon her. She reasoned
in this way, that if she chose to make
sacrifices for Guy, Agnes need not share<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
them, and if she told her she surely would
insist upon it. And that was the reason she
thought it best for Agnes to keep part of her
own money.</p>

<p>"How little she suspects," she thought as
Agnes sat down to rip her dresses, looking
quite satisfied at having to do with her old
clothes. "What a sweet spirit our Agnes
has."</p>

<p>Agnes worked and thought. She did not
have the least idea how the money went, but
she knew a little more would not be amiss,
so she said: "If there was any other way in
which I could help you, Ruth."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," was the reply, "you
can direct Martha, and see to things when I am
out, that will be a great help; for although
Martha does remarkably well for a child of
her age, there are many things to be attended
to, requiring a more mature judgment."</p>

<p>"Quarter day" came, and when Agnes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
handed Ruth her money, it was returned except
the sum kept out for her board. "You
know it was decided that in future you
should have your own money, Agnes."</p>

<p>"But, Ruth, I don't understand. Why
should I when yours all goes for the house?"</p>

<p>"If it were not best, I should not urge it,"
was the reply, and Ruth seemed so positive
that Agnes yielded. Weeks rolled on and
to every inquiry made by Agnes as to the
time when Ruth meant to buy herself a dress
for winter, there was some trifling excuse
made. Finally she told Agnes there was no
necessity for her waiting, it would be better
if she bought hers now before school commenced,
and she could get her own whenever
she was ready.</p>

<p>"What kind would you get if you were in
my place?" asked Agnes, a new light breaking
in upon her.</p>

<p>"A poplin by all means, they will be worn
altogether."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the very thing," thought Agnes.
"I am sure now that she does not mean to
get any dress this winter, and she is so fond
of good clothes. Our Ruth is the most self-sacrificing
woman, I ever knew. Now it
would be different if it were I, for I do not
care for dress in the same way as she; but I
am so glad I thought of it, she shall have
one after all."</p>

<p>Full of this thought she set out to make
her purchases. After looking over several
pieces, she came to one that was just what
she wanted for Ruth, a rich brown of beautiful
quality. But the price perplexed her,
she could not get two and pay so much for
them.</p>

<p>"Have you any others of this shade?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"They are much coarser," was the reply,
as the salesman handed down several pieces
of inferior quality. After a great deal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
thinking and calculating, Agnes ordered a
dress of the fine material and one of the
coarser. "Will you oblige me by laying the
fine dress pattern aside for a few days until
I send for it?" she asked. "I will pay for
both now however." Then giving Miss
Smithers' address for the other, she left the
store and was soon at Miss Smithers' door.</p>

<p>Everything was explained. How that
Ruth never would think of herself, and it
was time some one should think for her, and
then Agnes arranged the time for having
them made.</p>

<p>"When mine is cut so that it cannot possibly
do for Ruth, I shall have hers sent. I
can hardly wait for the day," she said, with
the delight of a child. "Please cut my
skirt before then, Miss Smithers, for Ruth
will think it coarse and insist upon my sending
it back, unless it is cut. But it will
make up quite prettily, and in winter no one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
notices the quality of your dress." Guy
would have been amused at her business capacity
then, had he heard her.</p>

<p>Such a time as she had when she went
home. Ruth could not understand why the
dress was sent to Miss Smithers', instead of
there. "Just as like as not you have been
cheated," she remarked, "and then when the
skirt is cut there is no help for it. To be
sure it will be an assistance to have some of
the cutting done."</p>

<p>Then came Miss Smithers and the dress.
With assumed calmness Agnes showed it to
her sister, but not without many secret misgivings.</p>

<p>"There, isn't it pretty, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very, but it is extremely coarse,
Agnes. Why didn't you get a <i>good</i> dress?
You have enough second-best ones for this
winter."</p>

<p>"This will answer nicely now, I like it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Besides, I did not want to spend all my
money on a dress."</p>

<p>"Well, if you like it, and as long as it is
cut, there is no use in making you dislike it.
It is all well enough if it were not such a
poor quality."</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, when there was little
more to be done by the sisters, the rest
being Miss Smithers' special work, Agnes
asked Ruth if she could spare Martha to go
on an errand for her. Handing her a note
and telling her to take it to the address and
wait for an answer, Agnes sat down to await
the <i>denouement</i>.</p>

<p>"O dear, I wish it was over," she thought.
"I am almost afraid to show it to her. I feel
as badly as if I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dad'">had</ins> done something wrong.
Is it ever right to deceive? Of course this
does not harm any one, and I did not see any
other way in which I could manage it;
but after all it was taking advantage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Ruth, and it may give her pain instead of the
pleasure I intended." These and many
other questions passed through her mind as
she sat waiting for Martha. Presently she
appeared with the parcel.</p>

<p>"Open it, Ruth, it is yours," said Agnes,
determined now to face it at once. "I
bought it and mine at the same time, but I
kept it purposely until to-day."</p>

<p>Ruth was so touched by this thoughtfulness
on her sister's part, that she was a long
time in untying the cord. She did not want
to look up just then, for her eyes were full
of tears.</p>

<p>"Let me," said Agnes, and she drew it
away from Ruth. "It is almost the same
shade as mine," she said, holding it up to
Miss Smithers.</p>

<p>"Well, now, so it is," replied that lady,
laying down her work and taking the new
dress pattern. "They are as nearly alike as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
two peas. If people did not know you so
well, they would take you for twins."</p>

<p>"O, Agnes, it is ever so much finer," exclaimed
Ruth. "What did you do that
for?" She spoke as if it pained her, and
Agnes laughingly replied: "Because, big
sisters should always have the best things.
Now don't look so doleful, Ruth, one would
think you were going to be beheaded. I declare,
Miss Smithers and I would be bowing
and smiling like Frenchmen or Frenchwomen,
rather if we were having a dress presented
to us."</p>

<p>Ruth laughed and bowed, and then Miss
Smithers made one of her characteristic
speeches and so, "it was over," at last as far
as Agnes was concerned.</p>

<p>Not so with Ruth. She could scarcely
command herself for the rest of the day, she
was so deeply moved by this thoughtful act
of her sister. "And to think of her wearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
a common dress just for the sake of getting
me a handsome one," she said.</p>

<p>"Dear Agnes, if she only knew what
thoughts I have had about having to do
without things sometimes, she could never
love me enough to make this sacrifice. I
suppose it was providential; God had a hand
in it. But that is the strange part, that He
should reward me after all my complaining."</p>

<p>These were soul-expanding thoughts, and
had Ruth but taken them to God, praying
that they might be made the means of drawing
her into a closer union with Him, what a
wonderful change would have passed over
her. As it was, they gave such a softness to
her tone, and such gentleness to her manner,
that Martha, quite encouraged, ventured to
express her admiration of the dress, of the
giver, and of the receiver, in such a mixed
up way, that Ruth was forced to laugh outright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I got a beautiful idea the other day,
Agnes," said Ruth, as she sat stitching her
dress. "One who had been speaking of
her Christian life, said, 'in looking back she
saw some triumphs achieved, some enemies
slain.' While a friend replied that, 'in
place of every foe that had fallen some
grace sprang up.' I had not looked at it so
before; it is a beautiful thought."</p>

<p>"And comforting as well as beautiful,"
said Miss Smithers, with moistened eyes.
"But Agnes, here, don't know so much
about this thing of fighting as we, Ruth."</p>

<p>"If I don't, then I am not living a Christian
life," replied Agnes, earnestly. "For
the Bible says we must war a good warfare,
and if I am not doing it then I must be in
sympathy with Satan. Miss Smithers, Christians
make great mistakes about each other,
often. Because we do not see each other's
struggles, we think there can be none. Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
when I have the most to contend with, I do
not talk most about it, for no one can help
me but God."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure that is true. But it is a
most wonderful relief to me to speak.
When I have anything on my mind it has
to come out. But you are so gentle and
placid like. I really thought you were not
like other people."</p>

<p>"Well, now you will know, in future,
that I am like other people in my struggles,
faults, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bless me, not faults. I never saw a
fault in you, all the time I have known
you."</p>

<p>"There is a great deal in living with one
to know them. Ruth can tell you that."</p>

<p>"Everything," said Ruth, emphatically
as she left the room.</p>

<p>In matters of dress, the girls seldom approached
their brother. Perhaps because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
they so seldom had anything new. Then he
liked showy dress, and theirs was always
moderate. But at night, after Miss Smithers
had gone, Ruth could not help exhibiting
her poplin, and telling what Agnes had
done.</p>

<p>"Now that is what I call pretty," he said,
when Ruth threw it over her shoulder. But
when she told him it was a gift from Agnes,
a deep crimson overspread his face. In a
few minutes it was gone, and looking at
Agnes steadily, he said in a peculiar tone,
"How much you women are capable of
doing."</p>

<p>Neither of them understood him, but
there was something in his face and voice
that deterred them from questioning him,
and Agnes replied with a smile, "I am glad
you like it, Guy. I treated myself to one
at the same time, and it is made up ready to
wear."</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S EXCURSION.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 122px;">
<img src="images/r.png" width="122" height="200" alt="R" title="R" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />UTH and Agnes had joined the
Young People's Association, and
now there was to be a grand excursion.
Such an excursion as had never been
seen in Ripley. Guy had become acquainted
with the Rev. John Jay, through his sisters,
and as that gentleman had united his
entreaties with theirs that Guy should accompany
them, he was at last prevailed
upon. It happened to be the very hottest
day of the season, although the latter part
of August, and although Guy had several
times declared to himself that he would
"back out" of the affair, the extreme heat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
decided him. "He would go with a pack
of monkeys to the moon, or anywhere, for a
breath of pure air." Of all the gay parties
that ever set out from Ripley this was the
gayest. Scarcely a breath of air stirred.
People were astir because their business
compelled them to make some exertion, but
they moved about listlessly, as if the mere
act of living were a labor rather than a
pleasure.</div>

<p>The excursion was to start from the
church, where already there was quite an
array of omnibusses drawn up as much in
the shade as possible. So when six young
people came up breathless, their faces
flushed and eyes sparkling, hoping they
were not too late to get a seat, they did <i>so</i>
want to get among the green fields, out of
that stifling place, the horses pricked up
their ears, and the sleepy drivers brightened
up, having come in contact with the freshness
and charm of those glad gay natures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't make very good time to-day,
no how," said the driver of the coach they
were about entering. "It's going to be as
hot as blazes."</p>

<p>"All right, driver; we're in no particular
hurry. Any time this week will do," said
one of the young men as he clambered in.</p>

<p>"Isn't it delightful, none but ourselves,"
was the exclamation. But just then Guy,
Agnes and Ruth appeared, and took their
seats. By this time the other coaches had
been filled, the word was given, and the
party started off amidst cheers and waving
of handkerchiefs. It was for the time as
if a fresh breeze had suddenly sprung up,
giving new life to the town through which
they passed.</p>

<p>"Can't you turn into a by-road soon,"
said one; and "O, please do, it is excruciating
going over these cobble-stones," said
others. But the heat had not quite dried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
up the driver's fun, or else the street was in
very bad condition, for just as this was said,
they were bounced up like so many rubber
balls, and the driver, with a twinkle in his
eye, remarked that there could not be more
than a mile or so of that kind of road.</p>

<p>"Are there any undertakers along this
road?" asked Guy, seriously.</p>

<p>"Undertakers! what do you mean, Guy?"
said Agnes, quite shocked at his levity.
The whole party set up a laugh in which
the driver heartily joined, knowing what
had called forth the remark.</p>

<p>"I merely thought we would require the
services of one, if not more, at the rate we
are going, especially as there is a mile more
of such road."</p>

<p>In the midst of another laugh which followed
this speech, the coach turned off into
a shady lane where the trees on either side
almost met, forming a delightful shelter from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the sun, which was now pouring down its
rays most lavishly.</p>

<p>Through sun and shade the horses kept
up their trot, the driver being called to repeatedly
to be kind to them, until the joyful
announcement, "The woods, the grand old
woods!" was made. Just at the entrance
to the woods stood a hotel. And the arrival
of the coaches made quite a stir at the
"Cross Keys," as it was called. The proprietor
was aroused from his slumbers under
the old chestnut tree at the end of the
house, where he had been vainly endeavoring
to fix in his mind some of the previous
week's news; judging from the paper which
lay on the grass, and the spectacles which,
just resting on the tip of his nose, seemed
ready to follow the news,&mdash;by the barking
of the dogs and the scampering of servants.</p>

<p>"Bless me," he gasped, "if there ain't a
load. Pretty plucky whoever they are to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
travel this sort of weather." And gathering
up himself and his glasses, he made as
great speed towards the front of the house
as his roly-poly figure and the heat would
admit.</p>

<p>By the time he reached it, black Pete,
whose business was to attend to the stables
and do a little of anything needed about the
house, stood cap in hand, grinning and bowing
to the party who were alighting.</p>

<p>"Nice kind of a day this, friend," said
one of the young men, as Pete took his station
near the horses heads. "No heat to
speak of up this way, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Just a little, sah!" and Pete's grin was
broader than ever, while he rolled his eyes
in the direction of the girls. "It feels a
good sight breezin' since you come sah, de
young ladies, I mean." Here there was
another bow, and the whole thing, the bow
and the compliment was so overwhelming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that the girls ran laughing up the steps, almost
upsetting the worthy landlord.</p>

<p>Presently they were followed by the young
men who had staid behind to have another
word with Pete, and then those who had not
brought dinner, among whom of course were
Guy and his sisters, made arrangements with
the landlord for that meal, urging him to
bring out everything his larder contained, in
view of the fact that a party of ravenous
wolves were to be fed.</p>

<p>"This weather don't appear to set very
hard on you at that rate," he replied, his fat
sides shaking with merriment as he went off
to obey orders.</p>

<p>Then Guy and a few others began to
search for a cool place, in which to eat dinner.
First they tried the house, but it was
so dark they could not see, and when the
shutters were opened the flies swarmed in;
next they tried the porch, but the glare was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
too great. Some were beginning to be cross
and unamiable, when Pete's head again appeared.</p>

<p>"If de ladies and gen'lemen wants a nice
cool place, there's one over yonder in de arbor."</p>

<p>"O, yes, come and take tea in the arbor,"
sang the girls, as they bounded down the
steps and followed Pete, whose delight appeared
to equal theirs, for although the sun
could not penetrate the closely interwoven
vines, which covered it, neither could the air,
had there been a breath <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stiring'">stirring</ins>. But it was
"romantic" all thought, and Pete agreed
with them; though I question whether if
he had gone to the stake for it, he could
have told what the word meant. There was
one thing he <i>did</i> know, however, and that
was, that if they remained out of doors, he
could enjoy their society, and it was not
every day such a rare treat was his. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
while the party sought the woods until the
time for dinner, Pete went to bring out "de
table and cheers," thinking of the good time
he was to have, "listenin' to de grand talk of
dem town folks."</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the "wolves"
sought their prey.</p>

<p>"I guess dat here will do to begin with,"
remarked Pete, drolly, as he deposited on
the table two large dishes of chicken, and a
plate of tongue.</p>

<p>"Yes, that will do for the first bite," was
the reply, of one of the young men. Pete
showed his ivories and darted off again. But
on the return trip he had an assistant, and
between the two the board was amply
spread.</p>

<p>"I'll just be rusticatin' round here, Susan,
so you needn't stay," he said, as Susan announced
her readiness to "fetch them anything
else that was needed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl looked at Pete, then at the party.
Her look of inquiry was met with: "O, no,
there is no need of you waiting, if we require
anything he can get it."</p>

<p>Pete made a bow, and Susan, glad to be
relieved, thanked them and retired. Pete
would have acted in full the part of waiter;
already he had installed himself behind the
prettiest young girl's chair, but he was requested
to seat himself outside and keep his
ears open in case of being needed.</p>

<p>Seating himself on the top step of the summer-house,
and leaning his back against the
lattice-work, he obeyed orders by listening intently
to all the conversation. He evidently
favored the ladies, from the nods of approval
and looks of delight which he gave at their
remarks.</p>

<p>It certainly could not have been from the
conversation that he was reminded of angels;
perhaps the bright, fair faces of the girls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
their light attire suggested it, but he began,
during a little lull in the talking, to hum:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O, gib me de wings of de angels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To fly away, to fly away,&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>before he had gone farther, there was an exclamation
of delight; "Don't stop, sing it
all, it is splendid!"</div>

<p>Pete chuckled and after wriggling round
to where he could see without being seen,
and clearing his throat several times, took
up the strain again; this time in a louder
key, and with the swaying of the whole
body, where before it had only been the
movement of the head.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O, gib me de wings of de angels,</span><br />

And the Saviour will say, 'Come sit down by my side,'<br />

</div>

<p>By the time Pete had finished he was in a
state of rapture, swaying from side to side
as though in fancy he were mounting upwards
on angel's wings. But he was brought out of
his ecstasy by the shouts of</p>

<p>"Bravo! well done for you, Pete."</p>

<p>"Where did you learn it?" eagerly inquired
Agnes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"At de camp, Miss," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Why, were you in the army, or were you
a slave?" another asked.</p>

<p>Pete rolled his eyes until nothing but the
whites could be seen, as he said, "At de
Camp-Meetin', you know. No, ladies, I
never was a slave only to old Satan. Dat
was enough of slavery for dis here darkey."</p>

<p>"Say, now, tell us how he treated you,
that's a good fellow," said Guy, handing
him some loose change out of his pocket.
"This is for singing, now go on."</p>

<p>Poor Pete's face grew very grave. "It
ain't very pleasin' to tell of, and ef it's jest
de same, I won't scare de ladies with talkin'
about it."</p>

<p>"But we wish it," they said, and as there
was no help for him, Pete began.</p>

<h3>PETE'S SLAVERY AND FREEDOM.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/w.png" width="169" height="200" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ELL, it's rather flusticatin' to tell
grand folks like you about a darkey
what's of no account, but I
thinks of it considerable when there ain't
much else to do. You see I had a father
and a mother, and my father wasn't of much
account for he drinked like a fish. Then he
walloped us all round, and come pretty near
killin' the whole of us like he did mother."</div>

<p>"Killed your mother, the wretch! what
did you let him do it for?" asked one of
the girls excitedly.</p>

<p>"Couldn't help it Miss; but I'm comin' to
that. Well, you see he got drunk and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
walloped us, and mother said she weren't
going to slave herself for a animal like him,
so when he came home drunk she wouldn't
give him nothing to eat, and that made him
furiouser.</p>

<p>"Mother said he might bang till he got
tired, so she used to lock herself in her
room and take us with her, and then when
he got tired cussin' and swearin' he lay
down and went to sleep. Mother worked
hard enough, I tell you, to get bread for us
all: you see there was six of us, and it took
a powerful sight of wittles. She never said
nothin' about workin', though, only when
father broke up the cheers and things, and
then she used to cry, and we all cried."
Here Pete drew his hand across his eyes,
and the girls looked pityingly at him. In
spite of the pain caused by such recollections,
they were so curious to know all, that
Pete was again urged to go on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I helped de best way I could, for
I was a little shaver then, and Jim, he was
next to me, he did little jobs for de white
folks around. But father he got worse, and
wouldn't work no how, and he was always
gettin' took up, and then when they let him
out of jail he was furiouser than ever. One
night, O laws! I most wish I'd never gone
and been born when I think of that, mother
and all us children was asleep. Father had
been took up, and so we wasn't afeard of
nothin'. It was a snowin' and a blowin' sky
high, and nobody could hear nothin' for the
wind. All at once I felt somethin' a movin'
over my face, soft like, and then it made for
my throat. Then I ups and gives a spring,
and run into mother's room, but somethin'
tripped me, and I fell down right on top of
it. Then it moaned out like, and&mdash;and I
knowed it was mother a lying there, and
that somebody had killed her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I began to call 'murder' as hard as I
could, but father, it was him did it, got a
hold of me again, and told me he'd soon
shut up my fly trap. I know'd he was goin'
to do it, so I give an awful leap and sprung
clear over his head and right out in de snow.
I know'd he wouldn't go far to katch me,
for he'd have enough to do to clear hisself,
so I waded along till I come to de man's
house that Jim worked for.</p>

<p>"He had two awful fierce dogs, and one
of them made a spring at my throat while
de other caught hold of my leg and took a
bite out. De man, hearin' de dogs, put his
head out of de window and asked what was
de matter. So, as I couldn't speak, I just
groaned, and he told de dogs to lay down.
Well, he came down and took me in de
house, and all I could say was 'Father,' and
'Murder.' So he called up de rest of de
men folks and took them over, but when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
they got there father was gone, and mother
and de baby was dead. Poor mother, she
was holding de baby tight to her bosom.
De other childerns was screechin' and cryin',
and de door was wide open, and they
was nearly frozen. Well, de poor house
buried mother and de baby, and took all de
children but Jim and me, and de man Jim
worked for said he could stay thar as long as
he wanted help. I hadn't no place to go to,
so I worked where I could, and that wasn't
much because it weren't de time of year for
work, and I slept in sheds and barns,
wherever de folks would let me.</p>

<p>"Mother she was a good woman, and
made us say our prayers every night, but
I didn't say 'em any more after that night,
because I didn't see de use of prayin' to
God when he let my mother get killed. I
hated God then and I said so to Jim, only
nobody else talked to me about them things,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and I didn't get a chance to tell 'em. It
was a good many years that I went on that
way, only I got steady work. One summer
de fellows said thar was goin' to be a camp
meetin' somewhar near, so I concluded to go
and see what it looked like. So I sets out
on Sunday mornin', and when I seen de
white tents, and heard de people singin' and
shoutin', I thought it was de curiousest
thing I ever seen. I got along tolerable
well, talkin' to de colored folks what waited
on de tables, when all at once a big horn
was blowed, and everybody went off to
preachin'.</p>

<p>"I went too, jest to look on, and when de
preacher give out his text he said, 'Thou
God seest me.' I didn't think I need to be
afeard, for I didn't steal nor nothin', so I
looked him square in de face. But by and
by I began to feel queer, and then I begin to
look down on de ground. It appeared as ef<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
old Satan was a tryin' to drag me down to
de bottomless pit, and I know'd ef he'd git
me thar once, he'd take care to hold on to
me pretty tight. I was afeard to look down,
expecting every minute to be swallowed up,
and I couldn't look up for I know'd God
was looking at me. All at once something
appeared to pull me down, and thar I lay
while de people was a singin' and a prayin'
all around. After a good spell somethin'
spoke and says: 'Look up, Pete;' and I
says, 'What's wantin'?' Nobody didn't
give no answer, so I begin to groan agin.
Then somethin' spoke agin louder, and says:
'Don't be afeard, Pete, it's me.' I kind of
looked up, but didn't see nobody lookin' at
me, so I felt worse. Then the third time
somethin' says: 'Rise, Pete, your sins is all
forgiven.' I says, right out loud; 'Who
says so?' and de same voice, only sweeter
and more lovin' says, 'De blessed Jesus;
you needn't to be afeard any more.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you I jumped up quick, and began
to laugh as hard as I could. Some of de
people said I was crazy, but de pious folks
said I had got a blessin'; and so I had, de
blessedest blessin' ever I got. Dat's about
all, ladies and gentlemen," and Pete, bowing,
betook himself to clearing the table.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Jay, who with the rest, had
been an attentive listener, now said: "To be
able to tell that last part, my friend, is worth
more than all the world to a man; 'for what
will it profit a man if he gain all the world
and lose his own soul, or what will a man
give in exchange for his soul.'"</p>

<p>"That's so, sah," replied Pete with glistening
eye, "he wouldn't be of much account
no how."</p>

<p>Several more hours delightfully spent in
the woods, and then the coaches were announced,
and the homeward road taken, but
not without a parting word to Pete.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-by," called out the girls as they
drove off, and "Don't let old Satan play any
more pranks with you," said Guy, to all of
which he replied by bowing low, and saying:
"Thank you, ladies; thank you gentlemen;
take keer of yourselves, and don't forgit to
stop here de next time." He watched until,
not only their forms were lost sight of, but
until the dust which had been disturbed into
thick clouds, had settled; then turning
toward the house, he began his favorite air:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'XII'">XIII</ins>.</h2>

<h3>REV. JOHN JAY DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="142" height="200" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HE Rev. John Jay was not satisfied
that he had been true to the older
members of his flock. As a watchman
he had only faintly blown the trumpet
on some points, fearing the consequences.</div>

<p>Now in deep humility of soul, he plead for
grace to declare all the counsel of God. If
the spirit gave him utterance, need he have
fear as to the result? Was it not written,
"For as the rain cometh down and the snow
from heaven, and returneth not thither,
but watereth the earth, and maketh it
bring forth and bud, that it may give seed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the sower and bread to the eater; so shall
my word be that goeth forth out of my
mouth. It shall not return unto me void,
but it shall accomplish that which I please,
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
sent it."</p>

<p>Now he would cry aloud and spare not;
he would lift up his voice like a trumpet,
and show the people their transgressions, and
thus deliver his own soul.</p>

<p>With firm steps he ascended the pulpit,
that Sabbath morning, and with a heart full
of holy resolve. But as his eye fell on the
whitened locks and wrinkled faces of many
whose years almost trebled his, involuntarily
he cried: "Oh Lord God, I am but a child!
how can I do this thing?"</p>

<p>We know how quickly human love runs to
protect and comfort the little trembling one,
so when the cry was heard, there was a tender
gathering up into the arms of the Compassionate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
One, and there came a heavenly
calm and holy boldness. There was no
sleepers in church that morning, although
some questioned whether they were not
dreaming, as this youth, hitherto so modest,
and unassuming, in authoritative tones pointed
out to them their mistakes and the fearful
consequences arising from them.</p>

<p>We want men and women to go from
house to house, to gather in those who have
wandered from God. But whose fault is it
that they have wandered? Answer it, ye
fathers and mothers. Your judgment is better
than the Almighty's.</p>

<p>When the woman was taken in sin, he
said: "Martha do I condemn thee! go in
peace and sin no more." Didn't He open
up heaven just then, even to that sinner?
He who 'knew no sin.' But it does not do
for us, standing in our strength and wisdom,
to say to the weak and erring, to the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and foolish, "We feel for you; our hearts
are not too old&mdash;we are not too far removed
from you by grace, to know what snares surround
you. But we will gather about you
with loving hearts; we will give you kindly
counsel, not sharp reproof; neither will we
condemn you.</p>

<p>"How many little ones do you carry to
Christ every day, my brother, my sister?
Remember He expects you to lift them up
by your prayers and efforts, and bear them
to Him. He waits with open arms. Whom
by kind words and loving deeds, and earnest
prayer, have you drawn toward Him? Or
whom have you driven from Him, by reproof,
fault-finding, and holding yourself
aloof? You are afraid the church will be
desecrated by the gathering of our young
people; they will have such a pleasant, happy
time in their weekly meetings, that they
will not reverence God's house. Think you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
you are more pleasing in His sight, you who
turn out of the way the lame and the blind.
Ah, it were better never to have been born,
than by narrowness of soul, by false reasoning,
and warped judgment, to have led
astray, or turned aside from God one of these
youthful souls. As fathers and mothers,
should you not rejoice that your children are
among you; that they are improving the
gifts bestowed upon them by God, and fitting
themselves to fill higher places in the
church and the world than you.</p>

<p>"And now, dear friends, fathers and mothers,
men and women naming the name of
Christ, by His love I beseech you, go out to-day
stripped of your prejudices, and your
robes of self-righteousness; go out with humility,
with yearning, Christ-like love, and
say: 'We are all sinners; we need each
other's help, and the Saviour has need of all.
We will go hand in hand through joy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
sorrow, through toil and temptation, up to
the gates of the Celestial city, up to the joys
at God's right hand.'"</p>

<p>So the Rev. John Jay delivered his soul.
So he scattered good seed, leaving the budding,
the blooming, the fruit bearing to
God.</p>

<p>But it did not all fall on good ground.
Some fell by the way-side, and Satan,
snatching it up, sowed seeds of discord in
its place. So that in a short time it became
evident there were two parties in the church.
Those who claimed to espouse the Lord's
cause, when in reality they were trying to
hold the doors of the kingdom of heaven,
so that none but those they thought fit
should enter, and others, whose watch-word
was: "All souls for Christ. Being all things
to all men if by any means we may win
them to Christ." The former said the Rev.
John Jay was intolerant, and a stirrer up of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
strife; that he was too much of a radical for
them, and consequently he must leave.
The latter talked to the Lord about it, and
determined to stand by His servant. Their
numbers were greatly augmented by the
young people, who declared if the minister
were dismissed not one of them would ever
enter the church. So the old and young
were brought together sooner, and in a different
manner than was anticipated by the
young pastor. But the "right" prevailed,
and the Rev. John Jay remained. He soon
began to miss a number of familiar faces,
while at the same time he observed, with
great satisfaction, many for whom he had
heretofore looked in vain; some of them the
young men who had been induced to spend
a social evening with him each week in his
study, and among them was Guy Gorton.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry he found that brother
Smith, as leader of the movement, had decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to worship God in a room of "their
own hiring, where there was no young boy
to teach them their duty."</p>

<p>As the croakers went out, the young people
flocked in, and never did Fourth street
church witness such a revival as during that
winter. Side by side were found gray-haired
parents and their children seeking to
learn of Jesus' love, and many a heart that
had long resisted all other influence, was
led by youthful pleading to forsake sin and
turn to Christ. Old and young were secretly
drawn together in the bonds of Christian
love and sympathy. Even the Association
became a family gathering at which
the young people did the work and entertained
the older folks, they, good, simple
souls thinking there never were such talented
young men and women, and there
never could be such a society as the Association
of Fourth street church. "But,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
they added, "all this and much more, would
never have been but for our dear, faithful
pastor, the Rev. John Jay."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'XIII'">XIV</ins>.</h2>

<h3>"WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR A NIGHT."</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 128px;">
<img src="images/g.png" width="128" height="200" alt="G" title="G" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />UY had lost his cheerfulness, his sisters
thought. Certainly he had not
his old gayety of manner, and they
anxiously inquired if he were sick.</div>

<p>"I am sure you must be," urged Ruth;
"won't you see a doctor, Guy? Then there
is another thing, you read too much; indeed
you will injure yourself if you continue to
study so."</p>

<p>But he only laughed at their fears, and
continued to spend his evenings at home
over his books. Seeing that he did not seek
other society, the girls gave little entertainments;
not costing much to be sure, not
more perhaps than some little things they
needed, but now did without, so that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
might be surrounded by pleasant company,
and acquire a taste for the society of good
people.</p>

<p>Now it never once occurred to Guy that
his sisters were doing this for him. He
thought they must be becoming more fond
of society, and it pleased him very much, for
he did not see why they should not shine in
the very highest circles. Before long he
meant that they should. And now when
their friends came, he did his best to entertain
them for their sake, and they were overjoyed
at his returns of brilliancy and wit.</p>

<p>Now that the winter had really set in, and
promised to be severe, Ruth recollected that
Guy's overcoat had not been taken out of
the cedar chest, where it had been laid in
Spring.</p>

<p>"It is no wonder he has not asked for it,"
she thought, as she looked at the thread-bare
sleeves, and noticed the rusty appearance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the whole coat. Spreading it out, she looked
at it, then sitting down thought of what
could be done. "Now there is hartshorn,
that dissolved in water, cleans cloth beautifully;
but even if I did scour it, Guy could
never wear a thread-bare coat."</p>

<p>Then came the question: "How can he
get another? I know if he could, he would
have had it by this time. I must have been
thinking of myself and my own clothes, or I
should not have lost sight of this so long. I
will see how much money there is; at any
rate if it should take every cent in the house,
Guy must have the coat."</p>

<p>For a long time Ruth sat in the cold room
making plans; finally she decided to have a
talk with Agnes about it, because it would
never do, not to let her have a share in the
pleasure of making Guy comfortable. That
night the bed-post and rocking-chair were
appropriated, and there was a long, earnest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
talk. Agnes was not so much surprised as
her sister anticipated, when she found that
Guy was a great way off from making a fortune.
For ever since the time Ruth refused
to purchase her dress, Agnes had been finding
out things she never dreamed of before.
It was Ruth who was surprised to find that
Agnes knew so much of the real state of affairs.
In one way it was a relief, now that
she did know, and Ruth felt that a great
part of her burden had gone; but it was gone
from her to be laid on Agnes, and that
thought was more painful than the burden
had been.</p>

<p>"It is to be divided equally, remember,"
said Agnes. "O, I am so glad that I am
earning money, Ruth."</p>

<p>Ruth urged that as she was older, she
should bear the greater part of the expense;
but Agnes would not consent to this; and
finally it was settled that each should give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
half. Then they were perplexed as to the
manner of doing it. Agnes thought it best
to tell him, and let him order it himself; but
Ruth was sure he would not take the money.
Three months before, she would not have hesitated
to offer it; but he had changed since
then, and something told her he had resolved
to be less dependent in the future.</p>

<p>"I don't like concealments," urged Agnes;
"I felt meanly in acting so about your dress,
Ruth."</p>

<p>Ruth smiled, and said: "You always had
a tender conscience, child, but there is no
other way of doing this, I am convinced."</p>

<p>Agnes yielded to Ruth's judgment, and
Martha was sent with the old coat to the tailor,
and told to say that Miss Ruth would
call in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"When is it to be done?" asked Agnes,
eagerly, when Ruth returned.</p>

<p>"On Christmas eve; and only think,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Agnes, it will be four dollars less than we
supposed. He will make it of the finest
cloth too."</p>

<p>"Christmas is coming," said the children
many, many times, during the ten days that
followed. Ruth's visit to the tailor, and
"Christmas is coming," said she and Agnes,
as many times as the children. Yes, Christmas
was coming, it was drawing near, bringing
gladness as it always does; but something
else was coming, and drawing still
nearer.</p>

<p>The shadow of a great sorrow had fallen.
Had they looked in Guy's face they would
have seen it; but they were busy with their
little presents for each other, and for Martha
and Philip. Besides, they rather avoided
Guy, for fear he should read their secret.
So it grew and grew, until they could escape
it no longer. Guy was ill of a fever.</p>

<p>All at once, without a word of complaint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he was taken down, and to all their entreaties
that he would speak to them just
once, there was no reply.</p>

<p>"O Guy, my brother, my darling, speak,"
moaned Ruth, as with an agonized voice
and look she bent over him. "To think
of your lying here alone, suffering through
the long night, and no one near to give you
even a drink of water."</p>

<p>So she went on talking and bathing his
burning brow, while Agnes, giving one
earnest look, in which her whole soul
seemed to go out, hurried to send Martha
for the doctor; then she went back, and
putting her arm round Ruth, drew her
away.</p>

<p>"Don't take me from him, Agnes; I have
the best right here," she cried, fiercely,
starting up from the seat into which Agnes
had placed her. "I did not help to benefit
him; I set him no good example. I must
save him now, even if I should die for him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sister Ruth," and her words were slow
and measured, "our lives cannot save Guy;
only one power can. Look to God, dear
sister; he is our only help. And He <i>will</i>
help us," she added with strong emphasis.</p>

<p>"O, will He, Agnes; are you sure?" and
Ruth looked into the face of her sister,
waiting for her reply, as if into the face of
God.</p>

<p>"He will help us," came again. Then
they threw their arms round each other and
cried.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Agnes, when the
doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"Brain fever, I fear," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Will he die?" almost shrieked Ruth.
"You will save him, doctor. O, you won't
let Guy die."</p>

<p>"Do you know, my child, you can kill
your brother, and you will if you give way
to this grief. I will leave no means untried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
You are a Christian; you know how
to pray; there is greater comfort in that
than in any of my assurances; but I give
them to you; your brother shall live if it is
in the power of man to save him."</p>

<p>Agnes murmured, "O God, give him
skill, and give us strength," while hope revived
in Ruth's heart, and she listened
eagerly to the doctor's directions.</p>

<p>"You will have many days of nursing, it
is probable, and you must take it in turn,"
he said; "but at night it will be well to have
a friend. There is a great deal of restlessness
then, and one feels lonely. Be sure
you give the medicine promptly, and keep
up the ice applications, as I shall be back in
a few hours."</p>

<p>"Whom can we get?" asked Agnes,
when he had gone.</p>

<p>"Don't let us have any one, Agnes; no
stranger could take care of Guy, as well as
we," said Ruth, beseechingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Ruth, if anything should happen,
if Guy should grow worse, we would blame
ourselves for not doing all the doctor told
us."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. You know best,
Agnes. I can't think to-day."</p>

<p>Without saying more, Agnes went down
stairs, and told Martha to see if Miss Smithers
was at home, and if so to tell her to
come right away, but not to sew. "Then
leave this note with one of the school children,"
she added.</p>

<p>She met Ruth's scholars as they came, and
sent them away quietly, telling them when
Miss Ruth was ready she would send them
word, and then she tried to take her breakfast.
"I must be strong," she said, and
tried to eat, but she could not swallow.
There was Guy's place, but he was not
there. "Will he ever be again!" The
question came, but she drove it away. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was in God's hands and so was she. She
could take nothing back, but rest in the
thought of His fatherly love and compassion.</p>

<p>Miss Smithers came, and Agnes was not
mistaken in her. She was ready for every
emergency, and never failed to give the right
comfort, at the right time. Even Ruth grew
to depend upon her, and to miss her kind
face when she was compelled to leave them,
and seek rest. Agnes had not thought of
asking her to give up her work, only to have
her stay with them at night. But Miss
Smithers did not mean to leave either day
or night, until Guy was out of danger, and
Agnes gladly yielded the point.</p>

<p>When the sorrow through which the sisters
was passing, became known, they had
the fullest sympathy of friends. Miss Smithers
received all who called, and thus saved
them from many painful interviews. For at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
such times when there are many hearts to
feel for us, and to offer the most delicate expressions
of sympathy, there are always
coarse natures who know no other manner
of showing their sympathy than by opening
up our wounds and making us bleed afresh.</p>

<p>"How many friends we have, Agnes. I
did not know so many cared for us. If Guy
recovers we shall be very happy," said Ruth,
as Miss Smithers told them of the many who
had called.</p>

<p>Guy lay still unconscious, while the fever
leaped through his veins, and almost purpled
his fair face. Now he was at his books, then
again he was pleading; but all the time
there was this thought: "I can't rob Ruth,
I can't take her money."</p>

<p>"O, if he would not talk so; if he would
say anything else but that, I could bear it,"
she moaned, and then she whispered that
"Ruth, his own dear Ruth was there, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
he must not talk any more," but still he
went on in the same strain.</p>

<p>Poor Agnes was sorely tried. Here was
Ruth breaking out in the wildest frenzy, at
times, refusing to eat or to leave the bedside;
and here the brother, far dearer to her
than life, not able to look at her, nor to say
that he understood her when she did not
yield to his wishes. If he died, he could not
know how great her love for him was. And
then the subtle tempter came: "If God
loved His children He would not cause them
thus to suffer. <i>Your</i> life has been harder
than that of out-breaking sinners." But
while Agnes could not reason, thank God
she could trust, and reaching out her hand
as a little child, she said: "Lead me in
the way that is best for me, and do not let
me be afraid or discouraged."</p>

<p>Christmas had come and gone, but they
would not have known it, had not Guy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
coat been sent home according to promise,
the day before. They had meant to hide it
from Ruth, but she happened to be down
stairs at the time it came, and it was kissed
and fondled as though it had been Guy himself.
Then it was laid away, no one else
knew where. She forgot that Agnes had a
share in it, forgot everything but that it was
Guy's, and he her own darling brother.</p>

<p>Agnes had never asked the doctor any
more questions since the day Guy was taken
ill. But she wrote down his directions for
fear the least thing should be overlooked,
and never administered medicine, or rendered
him the slightest service, without
breathing a prayer that it might lead to his
recovery. So the days passed wearily on,
and the crisis drew near.</p>

<p>"We must not tell them," said the doctor
to Miss Smithers, on the morning of the
day. "It will only more completely unsettle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Miss Ruth, while the other poor child
need have no more laid upon her. If the
worst comes, there will be strength given,
and anticipated trouble is always the hardest
to bear. If you have any influence over
Miss Ruth, keep her very quiet, everything
depends on that."</p>

<p>Miss Smithers went up to her room, and
was there for a long time. When she left it
she carried with her something that made
her heart strong and her face bright. If
you have ever known it you will understand;
if not, no words can give you the
idea.</p>

<p>The day wore on and still Guy was restless.
The doctor came, looked and went
away, but there was no outward change.
Night closed over them as they sat watching,
the two to whom he was the dearest
living thing, and another whose heart had
been drawn toward him as if he had been
her son.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>If faith were dependent upon what is seen
only, then Miss Smithers might have yielded
to the entreaties of Ruth and the imploring
looks of Agnes, to let them stay beside Guy,
whose unrest was painful in the extreme,
for there surely could be no hope here.
But she kept them beside her, whispering:
"Trust me this once, children;" and in
some way they felt that she must be right.</p>

<p>It was near midnight on the last day of
the year. What would the New Year
bring?</p>

<h3>"BUT JOY COMETH IN THE MORNING."</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="142" height="200" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HEY sat, each one busy with her
thoughts, so very different, perhaps,
and yet in one respect so alike,
when suddenly they became conscious of a
change. The sisters started, looked quickly
at Miss Smithers, and then would have ran
to the bedside, but laying a hand on each,
she said, with strong emphasis, "If you
want your brother to live, you will not move
from here."</div>

<p>They looked at her in surprise, then the
truth dawned upon them, and turning, they
clasped each other's hand and prayed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Softly Miss Smithers crept toward the
bed, and stooping down she scanned the upturned
face. As she raised her head she
met the searching gaze of Ruth and Agnes.
She smiled, then pouring into a spoon a
liquid left by the doctor, in case of such a
change, she gave it, then turning down the
light to the faintest glimmer went back to
her seat.</p>

<p>"He sleeps," was all she said, but
there was no more needed. They scarcely
breathed after that, they sat so still&mdash;holding
each other's hand until the gray dawn
of the New Year's morning broke, and the
doctor came.</p>

<p>His quick eye detected the change as soon
as he entered. How his face beamed, and
how they loved him then. Beckoning to
them when he left the room, they followed
into the one adjoining.</p>

<p>"Now, girls, there was a hard fight last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
night," he said, "but the day is ours, or
Guy's. What he needs is to have not a
finger moved in the room as long as he
sleeps. When he wakens you are each to be
as calm and fresh as a May morning, or it will
set him to thinking and bring back the
fever. Now both of you go at once to bed
after you take a cup of coffee, and sleep
until Miss Smithers calls you; then she will
follow your example. Remember on no
other condition can your brother recover,"
he continued, as they plead to stay and see
him waken. As he went out he said: "A
happy New Year, my children; you have
much to thank God for to-day."</p>

<p>O didn't they thank Him! Their hearts
were so full of joy and thankfulness that it
was a long time before they could forget
everything and sleep. It was noon when
they awoke, and yet Miss Smithers had not
called them. Stealing to the door they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
looked in; they wanted just one look at
Guy, to be sure it was true and not all a
dream, and then they went down stairs.</p>

<p>Martha, little woman that she was, was
overjoyed at seeing them and knowing Mr.
Guy would soon be well.</p>

<p>"You did not get your Christmas present,
dear child," said Ruth; "whenever brother
Guy wakens you may go up for it; it is in
the top drawer of my bureau wrapped up in
white paper."</p>

<p>"Miss Agnes gave me two white aprons,
all scolloped round," said Martha, with a
beaming face.</p>

<p>"You have been a good girl, Martha, we
could not have done without you," continued
Ruth. "When Mr. Guy is better, we
will tell him you helped to make him well."</p>

<p>"Mother said I should be as good as I
could, and if you wanted any more help, she
would stay all the time, because Miss Agnes
was so kind to father," replied the child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Smithers appeared looking very tired,
but cheerful. "Now girls you may go up,
he is awake and wants you. But there must
not be many words." Ruth took two steps
at once in her haste to get up, but she was so
out of breath, she had to recover before
going in the room, so that both entered together.
Guy was awake and knew them;
they could scarcely realize it. They kissed
him; then each held a thin hand and told
him not to speak. When he grew stronger
they should have a good, long talk. He
smiled faintly and then fell asleep again.</p>

<p>They would have gone away now, but
he held their hands in a tight clasp, and so
they sat for hours, until he awoke&mdash;tired
and cramped, yet afraid to move. That
night Miss Smithers insisted upon sitting up,
and they went to bed in their own room, but
not until they had had a long talk.</p>

<p>"This night, two years ago, Agnes, do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
remember?" asked Ruth, drawing her chair
over to the fire. "You recollect I went to
the theatre, and you refused. If Guy had
died, I know I should have lost my reason.
If it had only been that once, but although I
suffered agony then, you know how often I
have gone with him since. This came to me
all the time of his sickness: 'You mislead
your brother, if he is lost you are to blame;'
and O, Agnes, you don't know what I suffered!
But I promised God if he would
only spare Guy, I would lead a new life and
never enter such places again. I see my
mistake now, we can never 'do evil that
good may follow.'"</p>

<p>"And I have been thinking, Ruth, that I
have been at fault, in not making direct appeals
to Guy, about his soul. I thought it
was better to <i>live</i> right, so that he might see
there was power in religion; but I find that
one thing cannot take the place of another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
There must be <i>talking</i> and <i>living</i>, both. And
I think we had better talk more about ourselves
before Guy; we have shut him out too
much from these things, while in everything
else we have thought of him."</p>

<p>"If he would only become a Christian,
Agnes, how happy we should be. I should
not have a single care then."</p>

<p>"He will, Ruth, I feel it; he will be given
in answer to prayer and holy living. But we
must live so near to God, that we can <i>claim</i>
this at His hands."</p>

<p>Guy grew stronger. "Who could help it
with such care?" he asked. Agnes, who
was compelled to go to school now, very
often found herself in the midst of a recitation
wondering what she could take home,
or what she could make for him, when she
went home. Ruth gave herself up completely
to him. Feeling that as she had hindered,
so now she must be a great help to him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
every way. She copied and read for him,
and would not have hesitated to undertake a
case in court, so that it was of benefit to
Guy.</p>

<p>Sometimes as she sat with him, the doctor's
and druggist's bills came up before her,
and almost made her heart stand still, for
during all his sickness she had not been earning
anything, and they were depending upon
Agnes's salary for everything until she could
begin to teach again.</p>

<p>She almost despaired of ever being free
from anxiety, but looking at Guy her doubts
left her. God had spared him to them, and
she would trust Him to help them out of
their troubles.</p>

<p>Little Philip came every day, now that
Guy was able to sit up, and by his odd
speeches and persistent attempts at making a
picture of Mr. Guy, proved a constant source
of amusement, so that Guy looked for him
daily, after breakfast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth several times attempted a conversation
with her brother about the things on
her mind, but had always failed in the attempt.
It came however in this way. She
was sewing, and Guy had been reading.
Laying down the book and watching his sister
for a few minutes, he said: "I have been
thinking, Ruth, if all young men had such
good sisters as I, how few would go far
astray."</p>

<p>"O, Guy," she said, her eyes filling with
tears, "I have been anything but a good sister.
I thought of it day and night, when you
were ill, and it nearly drove me mad."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Ruth, I don't understand
you. What had you to blame yourself
for?"</p>

<p>"The great thing, my neglect of duty. I
did not hold religion up in its true light. I
lowered the standard, and you did not give
it proper respect. I wronged you, Guy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
I wronged God and my own soul. I meant
to tell you all this, but something kept me
back. My inconsistent life came up before
me, and I thought I would wait until you
had seen a change in me."</p>

<p>"I see it <i>now</i>," he replied; "One can see
changes more readily in you, than in Agnes."</p>

<p>"Because there is nothing to change in
her. Guy, I would give all the world if I
had it, to be the trusting Christian our
Agnes is. If you had seen her when you
were ill, you would have known how wonderful
she is. She thought of everybody
and everything, but never once despaired or
murmured. I think the Lord spared you
because of her."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked in a husky voice.</p>

<p>"Because, she said the other night, we
must live such lives that we can <i>claim</i> the
answer to our prayers; and that is not the
kind of a life I have been living. I did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
dare to claim anything; I only <i>begged</i> to
have you spared, and promised to lead a new
life."</p>

<p>Guy's thin hands went up to his face and
tears ran down his pale cheeks. "Now is
the time," thought Ruth, and going over to
him she threw her arms round him saying:
"I went with you, Guy, dear brother say
that you will go with me. Don't let us
three be separated any longer."</p>

<p>And this was Ruth, positive, self-possessed,
Ruth. She had never refused him
anything, and how much she had done for
him, he well knew, and at what great sacrifice.
He could not refuse her now, so he
drew her down, and kissing her, said: "We
will go together, Ruth, God helping me."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Agnes came from school,
her face beaming, as usual. She looked
from Guy to Ruth, then she knew.</p>

<p>"O, Guy, it has come at last?" she exclaimed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
laughing and crying at the same
time, and in her joy kissing Guy and Ruth,
again and again. Then Miss Smithers had
to know, and Guy's friend, the Rev. John
Jay.</p>

<p>That night they opened their hearts to
each other. Guy told them how when Ruth
showed her new dress to him, he had seen
himself in a new light, and resolved to be
their helper in the future instead of what
he had so long been.</p>

<p>"And I will be it yet, girls, don't fear,"
he added. "If you have to pass through
some trying days before then do not be discouraged.
It shall be seen my sisters have
a brother who is not willing to receive love
and everything else without a return."</p>

<p>When he was able to go out the coat was
brought from its hiding place. It had been
laid away with tears, now it was taken out
with smiles. Then both sisters helped him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
on with it, smoothing it here and settling it
there, their faces radiant with pleasure.
And Guy, in return, gave them what he
knew they would rather have than anything
else, a fond, brotherly kiss. They
walked with him as far as the office, where
Ruth had been that morning seeing that
Martha had swept and dusted it thoroughly;
but all the way there and home, they could
not keep their eyes from Guy, he looked so
handsome in his new coat. They had seen
no one like him all the way along.</p>

<p>Days, weeks and months rolled on, some
of them trying enough, as Guy had said.
But the spirit of faith and trust nerved
them for the struggle, and in the end the
clouds rolled away and the sun shone out.</p>

<p>Guy was at last able to fulfill his promise,
for he had now entered into partnership
with an eminent lawyer. Very proud he
was when he made them his first present of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
new dresses, but prouder still when he was
able to dress them "as such sisters deserved
to be dressed."</p>

<p>With their prosperity they did not forget
their dear old friend Miss Smithers, and
many were the tokens of love and gratitude
she received.</p>

<p>Both Ruth and Guy claimed an equal
right to Philip, and through them he became
a pupil of a celebrated artist; while
Martha, who was claimed by the entire
household, could not pretend to say which
she liked best, and all were served with the
strength and love of her whole nature.</p>

<p>They sat by the fire one night talking.
"I used to think it impossible for lawyers
to be good, earnest Christians, Guy," Ruth
said.</p>

<p>"And now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Now I see my mistake, for I know one."</p>

<p>"Thank God for the grace which can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
keep the soul unspotted in the midst of corruption
and temptation," was the reply.
"Yes, Ruth, I, too, have found that for
every man and every calling there is the
same grace, which if brought to bear upon
the life and calling, will exalt the meanest
and make it honorable. What are you
thinking of, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Of what you have been saying. If God
made such a master-piece as man out of
clay, He intends that he shall occupy a high
ground, morally, I mean, and place it within
the reach of all. How glad I am, Guy,
that true position is to be found in this attitude
of the soul before God, no matter what
the social standing is. Then I have been
thinking that if we left ourselves in his
hands, He would be continually adding gifts
and graces, rounding our angles, and bringing
out the full symmetry of every part, so
that by the beauty of our character we
would draw others to Him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Guy and Ruth exchanged glances, then
Ruth said: "Here is one who is all angles.
It would take a great deal of rounding to
make me <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'symetrical'">symmetrical</ins> and attractive."</p>

<p>Guy slowly repeated: "'But we all with
open face beholding as in a glass the glory
of the Lord, are changed into the same
image from glory to glory, even as by the
spirit of the Lord.'"</p>
